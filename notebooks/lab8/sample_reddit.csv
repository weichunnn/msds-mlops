Thanks for hosting this AMA!

Having ran large(ish) events in academic environments before, I've found that there is often a lot of friction and sometimes conflict with managing the expectations of different parties. Despite the public perception of scientists all uniformly striving towards one singular aim, this is sometimes not the case (thankfully it was uncommon in my experiences, but it did happen).

How do you manage the expectations of different teams trying to influence how the March is handled and organised, and how do you try to balance out any friction that often comes with such large events and movements?"

&gt; Learning by teaching others is extremely effective - a new study tested a key reason why


&gt; For a new study in Applied Cognitive Psychology researchers led by Aloysius Wei Lun Koh set out to test their theory that teaching improves the teacher's learning because it compels the teacher to retrieve what they've previously studied.

Summary

Teaching educational materials to others enhances the teacher's own learning of those to-be-taught materials, although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the learning-by-teaching benefit is possibly a retrieval benefit. Learners (a) solved arithmetic problems (i.e., they neither taught nor retrieved; control group), (b) taught without relying on teaching notes (i.e., they had to retrieve the materials while teaching; teaching group), (c) taught with teaching notes (i.e., they did not retrieve the materials while teaching; teaching without retrieval practice [TnRP] group), or (d) retrieved (i.e., they did not teach but only practised retrieving; retrieval practice group). In a final comprehension test 1 week later, learners in the teaching group, as did those in the retrieval practice group, outperformed learners in the TnRP and control groups. Retrieval practice possibly causes the learning benefits of teaching."

It might be interesting to see if a similar reduction occurs just prior to legalization of same-sex marriage.

Abstract

The corrosive effects of power have been noted for centuries, but the self-related changes responsible for those effects have remained somewhat elusive. Narcissists tend to rise to-and abuse-positions of power, so we considered the possibility that positions of power may corrupt because they inflate narcissism. Two pathways were considered: Powerholders abuse their power because having power over others makes them feel superior (grandiosity pathway) or deserving of special treatment (entitlement pathway). Supporting the entitlement pathway, assigning participants to a position of power (vs. equal control) over a group task increased scores on the Exploitative/Entitlement component of narcissism among those with high baseline testosterone. What is more, heightened Exploitative/Entitlement scores among high-testosterone participants endowed with power (vs. equal control) statistically explained amplified self-reported willingness to misuse their power (e.g., taking fringe benefits as extra compensation). The grandiosity pathway was not well supported. The Superiority/Arrogance, Self-Absorption/Self-Admiration, and Leadership/Authority facets of narcissism did not change as a function of the power manipulation and testosterone levels. Taken together, these results suggest that people with high (but not low) testosterone may be inclined to misuse their power because having power over others makes them feel entitled to special treatment. This work identifies testosterone as a characteristic that contributes to the development of the socially toxic component of narcissism (Exploitative/Entitlement). It points to the possibility that structural positions of power and individual differences in narcissism may be mutually reinforcing, suggesting a vicious cycle with personal, relational, and societal implications.

Also they consume approx 2.5 times the beef at 70% of their dietary intake verse 27% this means that if beef produced only twice as much green house glasses as the dietary choices of the lowest percentage group then the entire 500 percent is accounted for. The biggest problem here is gluttony not good choice. If there was less demand due to less consumption the. Steps could be taken to reduse  the footprint of the beef industry.

I have a few comments and questions, but first a little about my own background. I'm a professional scientist (PhD in Physics) who works at one of our national laboratories. Many of our national labs, including where I work, are more conservative than liberal due to the nature of the work we perform. On the political spectrum, I normally fall somewhere in the middle (social liberal/fiscal conservative with many nuances), trying to rely on being accurately informed prior to forming opinions, and openly willing to change my mind.

Because the march for science is a reaction to the suppression of scientific information by the current crop of politicians, and an attack on the scientific method more generally, I feel this is a crucial movement. 

I am concerned that this movement will devolve into an anti-Trump/anti-Republican agenda, allowing conservatives to easily dismiss the crucial advancements science provides for everyone (not only the general public, but also war fighters and national security, which are near and dear to the conservative ideal), by simply claiming the movement as a liberal agenda. Scientists know this is false, but scientists do not communicate well with the general public.

1. What ideas does the movement have to address the misunderstanding by the general public of the process and importance of science for the months and years after the march? 

I see this disconnect as more systemic than simply the administration/congress de jour. For example, the space race did wonders to cement the relationship between science and a positive popular opinion. 

2. What is the plan to help break free from a political label?  

This is of course complicated and nuanced. The reason for the protest is directly linked to the anti-science agenda that republicans have been pursuing for decades, but liberals are not immune to such stupidity. **I'm looking at you anti-vaxers**. One suggestion would be to encourage participants to RESPECTFULLY carry the American flag. I realize this is not something scientists are particularly comfortable with, and many scientists are not American by birth or identity. However, our protest is that the American government is not acting the way we think the American government should and the consequences are dangerous. We have to stand up and say ""Americans will not stand for our government behaving this way,"" and should therefore carry the flag as a symbol. In addition, popular opinion is swayed by images and video. Having a prominent American symbol associated with the movement will help persuade people, and make it difficult to be labeled as simply a liberal movement. In other words, the movement cannot come across as unAmerican.

"For those curious, the real interesting findings of this study imo is the actions of GABA in the hippocampus that are distinct from the dlPFC. The dlPFC and vmPFC have anticorrelated activity, I.e. when one is up, the other is down. In depression, for example, persistsnt negative self-rumination is very common and is linked largely to the abnormally low dlPFC activity (necessary for engaging with the external world) and abnormally high vmPFC activity (necessary for introspective processes) often seen in patients with depression. Both are part of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that projects to both the amygdala (anxiety) and hippocampus (memory and affective interpretation).

The general model has emphasized influences from the dlPFC low activity and hyperactivity of the default network, which is a network of brain regions involved in introspective processing of stimuli. The latter includes the vmPFC and sgACC. The idea is that hyperactivity of this network impairs the persons ability to recruit the dlPFC (or better yet, the fronto-parietal network) when allocating resources enabling engagment with external stimuli. This article shows, however, that the hippocampus plays a larger role in this process that is specific to GABA (the brains most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter). We already know the hippocampus 'gates' projections from the mPFC and amygdala to brain reward centers, and that this process regulates emotional processing. But this study shows that GABA influences at the hippocampus may be a mechanism contributing to the self-ruminating components typical of disrupted affective processing. 

Do note my research focuses around depression, so my context may be a bit off from the article.

EDIT: 
Lots of questions about treatment and clarity on the network. An easier interpretation of these results is that dysfunction of the hippocampus (I.e. low GABA) might reduce the ability of the frontal lobe (PFC, specifically the dlPFC) to engage in proper executive/cognitive processing. The dlPFC is also assoc. with 'turning down' other brain regions associated with excessive self-rumination. The idea, from my interpretation (sorry I'm on my phone and havent read the whole article), is that lower GABA levels are inhibiting the hippocampus' ability to aid in regulating this introspective processing, I.e. preventing hippocampal regulation over dlPFC processing. Im not familiar with the direct circuit between the hippocampus and dlPFC, though. It is important to note as well that this overall network is very complex, and i can't seem to identify exactly what model the authors are proposing. If you're interested, a good place to start learning is Googling ""LCSPT circuits.""

Also, for those assuming that taking GABA might help, it is important to remember that all drugs aimed at treating psychopathology act as 'shotguns'. If you take GABA it will influence many different things. A good example are SSRIs aimed at increasing serotonin levels. This also happens in the periphery, thus, often producing sexual dysfunction and weight gain. Please consult a specialist before taking ANYTHING (including supplements), *especiialy* if you are already on medication. 

EDIT 2: 
Also a lot of people making overarching assumptions based on the findings. Two points should be noted. 1) This is a network well-established in the neuroimaging literature, and these findings (I.e. low hippocampus GABA and modulation over dlPFC) are a great addition to it. 2) An important concept to remember in neuroscience is that GABA (being the brains most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter) does not always equal downstream inhibition. Sometimes you inhibit the inhibitor and create *more* excitation by disinhibting excitatory neurons. This is a exemplified by the mechanisms of ketamine and NMDA receptors. Its also similar with Glutamate (opposite of GABA acting as the brains most excitatory neurotransmitter) which might excitate the inhibitor, providing *more* inhibition. Thus, lower GABA might be a result of a multitude of different mechanisms. Please do not assume that 1) low GABA is causally defined here, and 2) that taking GABA or GABA agonists will help this specific circuit.

LAST EDIT: Thanks for the gold. 

I'd like everyone to understand something very critical to this overall network. The main idea behind some of this research is that patients engage in excessive *negative* self-rumination. This does not mean self-rumination is a bad thing. Please do not think that. Self-rumination /introspection can be *very* beneficial if harnessed correctly. The bad part is when that affective processing hyperfocuses on the ""negative"" stuff. So, stay positive and think about how your better than that little devil on your shoulder. Dont let your actions or experiences determine how you define your reality.

"I don't think I would put a lot of confidence in this study. They did a meta analysis (i.e., not their own experiment, but a study of the data from many studies) that looked at the relationship between smoking frequency and risk for smokers in general.  They fit that relationship with a non-linear model, and then extrapolated the results down to smoking one cigarette per day.  It's not like they used actual data for people that smoked one cigarette per day.  

Without someone being able to explain why this result even make sense theoretically, I highly doubt that the causal relationship between smoking one cigarette per day and hear disease is anywhere close to what this study suggests.

**Jurisdictions that sanction medical or, more recently, recreational marijuana use often allow retail sales at dispensaries. Dispensaries are controversial as many believe they contribute to local crime. To assess this claim, we analyze the short-term mass closing of hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles. Contrary to popular wisdom, we find an immediate increase in crime around dispensaries ordered to close relative to those allowed to remain open. The increase is specific to the type of crime most plausibly deterred by bystanders, and is correlated with neighborhood walkability. We find a similar pattern of results for temporary restaurant closures due to health code violations. A likely common mechanism is that ""eyes upon the street"" deter some types of crime.**

"I've been clinically depressed for the vast majority of my adolescent and adult life. Exercise has always been my ""drug"" of choice. Having tried more than a dozen different medications over the decades, and seen nearly as many therapists, along with a couple of psychiatrists, none of them have worked for long, or at all. Exercise does.

That said, though, just as a personal opinion to anyone who reads this and thinks it may help your depressed loved ones, it may not be what they need to hear. Telling someone who's majorly depressed ""Just go get some exercise!"" ignores one of the major psychological components of depression: hopelessness. You can't expect a majorly depressed person to be particularly proactive; far too often, they simply don't see the point in trying.

A *lot* of depressive behavior is counterproductive, of course; it only serves to deepen their depression and increase their isolation. But there's a certain ""safety"" to it, a constancy and familiarity that, as terrible as it is, is at least known, and the pain they feel is, at least, reliable. For many, it defines their very life and self-perception. This has been the case for myself, as well as for many other deeply, chronically depressed people I've talked to. It's just too risky and painful to try, when ""trying"" has, almost universally, been followed directly and brutally by failing. Forcing themselves to function as normal, in a world they aren't able to handle, with expectations they won't live up to, ruining relationships and squandering opportunities, is *devastating*. When it happens repeatedly, this leads to [learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness), in which they simply don't dare try to change their situation, as *everything* just...*hurts*. 

Then they feel worse because they fail even more to function like a ""normal, productive, human being."" It legitimately feels worse than pointless to keep trying, it feels like slamming their psyche with a hammer over and over again. Think of it like trying to walk on broken legs. It will very likely only make things worse and prolong actual healing.

How to get them out of this downward spiral depends on the person. For some, counselling may help get them standing. For others, medication. For others, a new hobby, new friendship, anything that makes them feel really excited and/or passionate, can help. After that initial boost, helping them to establish healthy self-care, including regular exercise, can get them moving again. But know that whatever worked for you, or for someone you know, or for so-and-so on TV isn't necessarily what's right for them. They just may not even be ready to change. And that's terribly frustrating, especially when it's someone you care for deeply. But it simply can't be forced.

Understanding this, and supporting them as patiently--yet prudently--as possible, is the best way to help them. 

So, in short, it's great to have still more evidence for the efficacy of strength training in countering depression. This is a wonderful thing to keep in the arsenal for that battle. But people have to be ready to hope, then act, first."

There is, as far as I'm aware, *nothing* wrong with GMOs- aside from a few ""natural"" companies that publish rotten fruit as a comparison without sourcing or any real science as a method. The worst that can be said is the business practice or implementation method. But their largest benefits is the reduction in materials waste and reduction in fungicide/etc., which you'd think everyone, including the ""natural"" crowd, would be supremely in favor of. 

If it weren't for GMOs, and if we went ""all natural"" on an industrial scale with farming, we'd suffer a plague of pests like the world has never seen. Which some might cheer- the downfall of ""industrial farming"" sounds good, until you realise we'll have a malthusian correction in the billions from mass starvation, and even your backyard potatoes wouldn't be safe from. You'd have to guard the roots and seeds with a shotgun day and night from neighbors- you might even fall to starvation yourself. How much you eat greatly outstrips what that theoretical backyard garden of yours can supply. 

The only way we ever cracked 2 billion was mass farming and industrialised equipment, which also freed people from working the farms to start using their productivity elsewhere, moving us even further past sustenance farming.

Yes, the planet might ""be saved"" in the long run from banning all GMOs and industrial farming, but you and over half of humanity literally owe their lives to its existence. To kick it over, should you ever be given such a choice, is to show the ultimate ingratitude, and to make the choice of whether one can live or not for another person, which is tantamount to murder on a mass scale.

They have been poked, prodded and twat-wanded more times than you can imagine, and they don't know if it's going to work. They are often facing higher doses of drug, particularly if they have depleted ovarian reserves, and larger injections DO hurt more. They are also worried about what will happen after the eggs are retrieved - only an estimated 50% of extracted eggs will make it to the 5 day mark (when they are usually transferred or frozen. Also, the women who are doing IVF for themselves will often also start preparing for an embryo transfer while waiting to harvest the eggs (which often includes large painful shots of progesterone in the ass), which may therefore be included when thinking about pain associated with IVF. 

Women who are donating are screened to see if they are candidates to make lots of eggs, and therefore may need lower doses of drugs, they have no emotional investment, and don't care how many eggs are produced, or what happens during fertilization. "

"i wonder if their results were bimodal...I feel like they should be. One large mode for those who perform better under pressure, and one small mode for those who do worse. Sampling would be key, because you need to choose a testable skill that can have both modes. E.g. sampling you concert pianist abilities is bad because 98% of pianists at a certain high caliber are only that way because they do well with an audience. Maybe something related to cooking? People can be pros at that in both cases...behind the scenes OR being watched. Helps that with cooking the pressure is on either way (your creation is served regardless, vs music that nobody hears) so that can partially control."

"I lost my best friend of 10 years to an opiod overdose just a little more than a week ago. I don't know if it was intentional or not, probably never will. We talked a lot, and one thing I could never seen to talk her out of was the idea that her life was meaningless, cruel, and most importantly, hopeless to get better.

The lack of hope is what really takes people down, IMO. I once read a study that said humans can endure an incredible amount of pain, as long as they know that it will eventually end. And that's what worries me. I hear from a lot of people in my generation that same type of hopelessness. I can see where it stems from: Crushing student debt, dead end jobs with no chance of advancement. Getting caught up in the criminal justice system, God forbid. Even more abstract things like climate change, they're all lingering in our collective subconscious.

To me, the opioid crisis and the suicide spike are highly related. Many of us feel stuck in a kind of late-capitalist hell-world, profoundly alienated, and some of us want out. I feel it too, but the thing that brought me out of my depression (for the most part) was joining the activist scene. Instead of being vaguely sad all the time, I got angry. I joined BLM. I joined the DSA. I channeled all that angst at trying to change the system that screwed my generation, that one day the people who destroyed the economy might be brought to justice. 

Besides channeling my angst into something useful, it also keeps me accountable. I have people who rely on me now, so I quit using drugs so much, my alcohol consumption is way down (hard to host a meeting/protest hung-over!).

So to wrap it up, I truly feel like if you're angry or depressed at the way life is turning out, help us. We want you. Even if it's not my exact organizations, just find something near you and check it out. There's no commitment, and I honestly feel it saved my life. That's all. Take care and feel free to PM me if you just want to talk, argue, anything. "

"I found out last year that I have a bad bone spur between my C5-C6 spinal vertebrae. For the first several months, no medication was enough to help me sleep properly. The most sleep time that I got straight over the course of about three months was 80 minutes.

I was given all kinds of narcotics, muscle relaxers, nerve pain medication, and none of it was enough to help me sleep through the pain for a long period of time.

I'm usually a well-adjusted, happy man. But towards the end of the three months, I found myself on several occasions laying in bed crying, wishing that I was dead.

It wasn't until I got a steroid injection into my spinal column that the pain started to go away. Within a week or two of the pain subsiding and my sleep returning, all of the crying and negative thoughts faded away.

**From the [HBR.org](https://hbr.org/2018/06/research-women-ask-for-raises-as-often-as-men-but-are-less-likely-to-get-them) summary article:**


&gt;Gaining access to a more recent, and more detailed, dataset allowed us to investigate this question anew. What we found contradicts previous research.

.

&gt;Even we were surprised by the results.

.

&gt;we found that, holding background factors constant, women ask for a raise just as often as men, but men are more likely to be successful.

.

&gt;We also examined the idea that women act less assertively in negotiations for fear of upsetting the relationship with their boss or colleagues. We found no support for this in our data.

.

&gt;we examined 4,600 randomly selected employees across 800 workplaces.  The sample is from Australia and the survey was completed in 2014. To our knowledge, it is the only nation with really good information on ""asking"" behavior.  Although a small country, it arguably has the interesting advantage for our work that it is representative of a mixture of cultures (with British, South-East Asian, American, and European influences).

.

&gt;Most of the statistical sources used by management researchers and labor economists do not record ""asking"" behavior, and do not record people's motivations for refraining from asking. But our dataset did have this information.

.

&gt;The younger women in the labor market appear statistically indistinguishable - even in ""getting"" - from the younger men. Hence it could be that negotiating behavior through the years has begun to change.

.

&gt;When early reports of our work appeared in the press, the research was criticized by Sara Laschever and others, in part for not having gone through a full peer review.  That peer review has now been done and the article is released this month in a major journal, Industrial Relations

.

&gt;At referees' request, after the further analysis, we were able to demonstrate to them that our main finding - women do ask - holds in both large and small companies, and holds for women with and without advanced levels of education. "

"There is a [quote I remember from Gavin Schmidt](http://www.nature.com/news/global-warming-hiatus-debate-flares-up-again-1.19414) that, I think, sums up how many people feel about the discussion of whether there was a slowdown in the pace of global warming in the early 2000s:

&gt; Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, is tired of the entire discussion, which he says comes down to definitions and academic bickering. There is no evidence for a change in the long-term warming trend, he says, and there are always a host of reasons why a short-term trend might diverge - and why the climate models might not capture that divergence.

&gt; ""A little bit of turf-protecting and self-promotion I think is the most parsimonious explanation,"" Schmidt says. ""Not that there's anything wrong with that.""

To what extent do you agree with Gavin? Is this discussion mostly an artifact of academic bickering? Is there room for nuanced discussion about the short term zigs in the warming data? Or do you think the issue has become too politicized?

Human race is doomed then.
"Human beings do this with abuse also. Even the good people that want to help victims often don't have enough backup to make a difference. 

There was a little boy in California named Gabriel Fernandez who was severely beaten amd tortured by his mother and her boyfriend.  His teacher wanted very badly to help and reported the abuse several times. Child services left him at home and then his mother and stepfather beat him worse for telling his teacher. She stopped reporting it when she saw that she was actually causing Gabriel to be harmed worse and that no one was going to protect him. A short while later his mother and her boyfriend beat him so badly that he died. He also had an older brother who wanted to help but also knew that no one would protect him or his little brother, and he would also cause the situation to worsen. 

These people systematically tortured a first grade boy, something most people would be horrified by, there was physical evidence covering his body, much of it in plain site. The reason I brought up this case is because I think it is a good example that shows our ineffectiveness as a species at stopping even the most urgent bad things, even when we overwhelmingly agree it's wrong.

I'm sure full articles will be published in rebuttal, but for now these responses offer the best explanation. The authors meant well but are clearly out of their depth. Shame on Nature for publishing this work when it was so obviously incorrect in its conclusions.  

The most conspicuous issue is that the majority of the ~1700 changes they detect in these mice are nucleotide replacements (different letter), as opposed to insertions/deletions. The former typos tend to happen randomly in organisms over time; the latter type of mistake typically results when CRISPR makes a cut. The changes they attribute to spurious CRISPR activity were almost certainly caused by another mechanism. The simplest explanation is that the CRISPR-treated mice were more closely related to each other than they were to the control mouse. Versus the control mouse, the two experimental mice had ~1700 changes, but ~1400 of those changes were in common. And very few of those ~1700 changes were similar in genetic code to the intended target, which *really* suggests that the changes are not CRISPR-related. The places CRISPR typically accidentally cuts (off-target or ""OT"" sites) are usually very [similar to the intended](http://i.imgur.com/tRUYhg3.jpg) site with a few different nucleotides. "

The average Australian has likely increased 66% in that span as well.  Not to poke fun but you could probably put data together to graph it.  
"""Narrow-minded"" is a pretty broad term that can refer to a lot of different things, so let's take a look at what the researchers actually did and found.

They took a look at 2 distinct types of information shared - conspiracy theories and scientific information - and analyzed patterns in how that information was shared on social media:

&gt;Fig. 3 shows the PDF of the mean-edge homogeneity, computed for all cascades of science news and conspiracy theories. It shows that the majority of links between consecutively sharing users is homogeneous. In particular, the average edge homogeneity value of the entire sharing cascade is always greater than or equal to zero, **indicating that either the information transmission occurs inside homogeneous clusters in which all links are homogeneous or it occurs inside mixed neighborhoods in which the balance between homogeneous and nonhomogeneous links is favorable toward the former ones.** However, the probability of close to zero mean-edge homogeneity is quite small. **Contents tend to circulate only inside the echo chamber.**

They also found differences in the so-called ""echo chambers"" between science news and conspiracy theories:

&gt;Science news is usually assimilated, i.e., it reaches a higher level of diffusion, quickly, and a longer lifetime does not correspond to a higher level of interest. Conversely, conspiracy rumors are assimilated more slowly and show a positive relation between lifetime and size. 

There's a lot of technical language in there, but essentially what the researchers seem to have found is that Facebook users tend to group together in homogenous groups, and that both science news and conspiracy theories tend to be shared within those homogenous groups rather than within mixed or heterogenous groups. There are some differences between science news and conspiracy theories in terms of the trajectory of how they are shared, but overall, it occurs within homogenous groups.

Given what's been discussed in the news lately, it can be tempting to dismiss this study as pointless or obvious. However, scientific research on exactly how information is shared on social media is pretty sparse, and given the relevance based on current events, confirming ""common sense"" and expanding our understanding of social media behaviors is sorely needed."

"Some of you might be asking yourselves the same questions I did upon reading this headline: ""Okay, so the study found that there was definitely a female viking there, how do we know she was a warrior?""

I'll cite the in my opinion most relevant part of [the actual paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.23308/full) that discusses this:

&gt;Male individuals in burials with a similar material record are not questioned in the same way. Furthermore, an argument can be put forward that the grave originally may have held a second, now missing, individual. In which case, the weaponry could have been a part of that individual's grave furnishings, while the remaining female was buried without any objects. However, the distribution of the grave goods within the grave, their spatial relation to the female individual and the total lack of any typically female attributed grave artefacts disputes this possibility.

&gt;Do weapons necessarily determine a warrior? The interpretation of grave goods is not straight forward, but it must be stressed that the interpretation should be made in a similar manner regardless of the biological sex of the interred individual. Furthermore, the exclusive grave goods and two horses are worthy of an individual with responsibilities concerning strategy and battle tactics. The skeletal remains in grave Bj 581 did not exhibit signs of antemortem or perimortem trauma which could support the notion that the individual had been a warrior. However, contrary to what could be expected, weapon related wounds (and trauma in general) are not common in the inhumation burials at Birka (e.g., 2 out of 49 confirmed males showed signs of sharp force trauma). A similarly low frequency is noted at contemporaneous cemeteries in Scandinavia (e.g., Helgesson Arcini, 1996). Traces of violent trauma are more common in Viking Age mass burials (e.g., Loe, Boyle, Webb, &amp; Score, 2014; Price et al., 2016).

Basically, there seem to be good reasons to believe that this woman was indeed buried to honor her status as a warrior but it's not as conclusive as I would have liked. That's not surprising, however, since interpreting such things can be dicey business and my field lies quite a bit away from this one. An interesting paper either way.

"Hi Ryan, and thank you for doing this AMA.

I'll be honest, I haven't followed the debate around net neutrality closely. But I am dubious of some of the arguments I have seen pop up to defend it.

The idea of net neutrality seems pretty simple. The company that connects your device to the internet should not be able to discriminate among users and content provides in terms of the level of service provided.

At first glance this sounds reasonable. But the more I think about it, the more I wonder if this is not over-regulation.

Why is it a bad idea to offer people services in line with their intended use? One size fit all policies are rarely optimal. To use cable as an analogy, I love being able to configure my cable package to fit my consumption preferences (premium channels, no ESPN). It seems like offering companies the opportunity to think about possible bundling options and offering a discrete a la cartel menu like this may be a good thing for consumers.

I wonder if continued de-regulation would be a good thing. Especially at the ISP level. In the current setting, I agree a worry over repealing net neutrality may be that people who lack other ISP options cannot vote with their wallets. But the better solution seeems to be to promote competition rather than enact regulations that favor companies already in the market."

2. Climate change will be expensive and we should do something about it now

Better to just explain the scientific consensus on 1 and only then delve into the quagmire of 2, which is not strictly speaking an issue for scientists. How much to do, when, is a speciality of economists and makes 1 look simple...
  

Economists have a consensus too, but it gets complicated... 1 is  a lot easier to convey if you save 2 for later."

"Does the homicide rate actually figure into these numbers in a statistically significant way?

The USA had 2,626,418 deaths in 2014, and 14,249 homicides. If the USA's total homicides were cut to match canada's rate (roughly 3.1 times less, a difference between 4.5 per 100k in USA and 1.45per100k in canada) it would have been 4596. The difference to the overall death rate for that year would have been 0.36%, which imo is fairly small on the grand scale of things.

Especially when the differences in suicide rate between the USA(12.1 per 100k) and a few other countries on the list are just as, or potentially more significant to total death numbers. For instance, with South Korea being the most improved in the linked article, it has a homicide rate of of 0.7 per 100k, which is very very low. However, its suicide rate is astronomically high at 28.9 per 100k, 2nd highest in the world.

Now, if you were to give the USA the same rates, there would be 12k less homicides, but also an additional 59.4k suicides. On balance, the additional 47.4k deaths per year would be a change of 1.8% more deaths in 2014.

Same goes in the opposite way with the countries with significantly lower suicide rates, there is a lot of variance in suicide rates and it is typically affecting numbers much larger than homicide rates in any given country. In most countries it is a very significant cause of death, especially in younger people( [2nd highest cause of death for 10-34yr olds in USA](http://www.sprc.org/scope/age) ) which would greatly affect overall lifespan averages.

Since suicides account for 3 times as many deaths as homicides in the USA, and suicide rates are slowly trending up while homicide rates are trending down, that seems like it would be a point of interest in studies about increasing lifespan but it wasnt mentioned in the article.

"I would like to refer people to this link posted as a source in the comments: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/apa.14291
That is the study the article talks about.

It details a study of a mere 55 children, apparently all from 1 demographic.
The study method involves observing the children's ability to interact with touch screens and to recognize people in videos. These children were aged up to 2 years old. A time when most kids can barely speak.

The result was that while they learned how to use buttons, they did not seem to know what the buttons were for.
They did, however, learn to recognize their parents on video. 
The result also notes that children PREFERRED to watch advertisements about toys, videos with music and dance, etc.
Thats it. Thats the sum total of the results as shown by the summary of the study (check for yourself). 

As such, the conclusion of this study is too general, it implies that youtube videos are not useful for education.
What it ACTUALLY shows is that kids under 2 years do not generally have the ability to understand the cause-effect relation between buttonpressing, and prefer videos with colors and music over videos without.

In other words, the title of this post is misleading, and to some extent so is the article lit links to. It claims that youtube videos are useless as tools to develop your toddler's brain. It shows that the children do not develop their brain by watching random youtube videos.
a thing that is implied in the article but not worded properly is that you CAN use youtube videos as a tool when you watch it together with your kid, but watching random videos of some guy playing Fortnite is not going to help your child. 

So neither the article or the study in any way rules out the usefulness of educational videos on youtube to older children. It simply rules out the usefulness of watching random videos for your &lt;2 year-old child in their ability to learn, without you helping them. If you start helping them learning, the videos could still be a useful tool.

We need to enlighten women around the world with the benefits of female circumcision, so they can consider this amazing medical advance for themselves.

1: 50% of all **vulval cancer** originates on the inner labia lips - so if you amputate those, vulval cancer is reduced by 50%.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulvar_cancer

http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/vulval-cancer/incidence#heading-Two


2: 1 out of 50 girls will be born with **labial adhesions**, where the inner labia lips are fused together. Cut those off at birth - and no more labial adhesions.

http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/labial-fusion/Pages/Introduction.aspx


3:  **Labial hypertrophy** can affect the inner and outer labia, and is where girls have bigger than average size labia - either one or both sides. Some young women will complain of a bulge in their underwear and an uncomfortable feeling with certain kinds of tight fitting clothing or when they are doing activities such as riding a bike, running, horseback riding or other kinds of activities that can cause rubbing of the genital area. Enlarged labia can cause irritation, discomfort, and pain in the crotch area. Irritation around the vaginal area can also be caused by chronic vaginal yeast infections, and large labia tend to hold extra moisture and bacteria often times resulting in more Urinary Tract Infections (UTI's). Intercourse may or may not be uncomfortable.

4:  **Clitoral phimosis** is present in 22% of women presenting with sexual health problems. This is where the clitoral prepuce/foreskin cannot be retracted to expose the external glans clitoris. This is linked to sexual pain, and possibly diminished sensitivity and impaired orgasmic capability.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11898701?dopt=Abstract

So much easier to have a female circumcision to avoid clitoral phimosis when you are an infant, rather than wait until you are an adult:

http://www.clitoralunhooding.com/


5: Women are 10 times more likely to get **UTIs** then men, as they have many folds of mucus membranes in their vulvas, and produce around 10 times as much smegma (a very healthy and natural excretions of the human body). These mucus membrane folds of tissue harbour the bacteria that cause UTIs - so if you cut-off the labia lips (and the clitoral hood) of females, you have a very good chance of reducing UTIs. (But this is *not* the case with infibulation as that increases the rates of UTIs).

And the same maybe goes for other infections and STDs.


6: Cunnilingus (oral sex) with women can give a man **HPV** (human papilloma virus) and this can trigger **throat cancer** in the man. So again, reducing the amount of vulval tissue that harbours the HPV virus might well decrease the chances of the man getting throat cancer.

It is a truely revolutionary study as it encompasses literally -***all***\- *psychedelic drugs*, since they mostly act on 5HT2-A receptors. Ketamine is thus not the only psychedelic that can claim the notoriety of possessing rapid-acting-antidepressant properties, and it also shows that ketamines MOA in terms of antidepressant efficacy is interlinked with 5HT2-A activation that leads to the subsequent downstream activations of glutamate receptors.

  
Thus a link exists between 5HT2-A activation and subsequent downstream activation of NMDA, AMPA and TrkB-receptors leading to an increased transcription of mTOR and raised levels of BDNF.

"The controversy around getting this specific with disorders is that is also has a direct impact on insurance codes and what types of treatment/therapy will get covered. From a clinical standpoint, I like the idea of differentiating diagnosis. For example, PTSD and complex PTSD should get treated very differently. They are similar but also impact the person differently. However, the nightmare exists in trying to get insurance companies to recognize it, have measurement tools available (these can take decades to test, perfect, and adapt for populations), and then start figuring out what research (especially long term) supports evidenced based treatment in this particular category. But I've also seen how easy it is for people to generalize what depression and anxiety look like even with specifiers.

**Abstract**

Objectives

Extant research clearly points to a correlation between place and health, specifically as it pertains to chronic diseases like obesity. The present study examines this relationship among a diverse set of compositional place indicators and obesity rates across census tracts in the 500 largest cities in the United States.

Methods

Using data compiled from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 500 Cities project and the Census' American Community Survey, the analyses examined aggregate relationships between sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics of census tracts and crude prevalence obesity rates in over 27,000 census tracts located in the 500 largest cities in the United States.

Results

Multivariate analysis confirms the place-chronic health connection. Regardless of variable groups, deteriorating places with higher concentrations of low-income, minority populations reported more obesity prevalence.

Conclusions

Place matters. The continuing burden of zip code in the United States for disenfranchised populations will likely continue to force policymakers to examine the role that place-based prevention and place-focused medical care plays in the future health and well-being of U.S. residents."

Patterns and prevalence of violence-related skull trauma in medieval London

Abstract

&gt; Objectives

&gt; This study aims to identify the patterns and prevalence of violence-related skull trauma (including the cranium and mandible) among a large sample of skeletons from medieval London (1050-1550 AD).

&gt; Materials and Methods

&gt; In total, data from 399 skulls, representing six different sites from across medieval London, were analyzed for evidence of trauma and assessed for the likelihood that it was caused by violence. The sites include the three parish cemeteries of St Nicholas Shambles (GPO75), St Lawrence Jewry (GYE92), and St Benet Sherehog (ONE94); the two monastic houses of London Blackfriars (PIC87) and St Mary Graces (MIN86); and the early inmate cemetery from the medieval hospital of St Mary Spital (NRT85).

&gt; Results

&gt; The overall findings suggest that violence affected all aspects of medieval London society, but how that violence was characterized largely depended on sex and burial location. Specifically, males from the lay cemeteries appear to have been the demographic most affected by violence-related skull injuries, particularly blunt force trauma to the cranial vault.

&gt; Discussion

&gt; Using both archaeological and historical evidence, the results suggest that violence in medieval London may have been more prevalent than in other parts of medieval England, particularly rural environments, but similar to other parts of medieval Europe. However, more studies focusing on medieval trauma, and violence specifically, need to be carried out to further strengthen these results. In particular, males from the lay cemeteries were disproportionately affected by violence-related trauma, especially blunt force trauma. It perhaps indicates a means of informal conflict resolution as those of lower status did not always have the newly established medieval legal system available to them."

"The risk factors affecting cardiovascular disease risk are extremely interconnected - one risk factor will almost always increase or worsen another.

One of the most evidence-based and longstanding risk calculators we use for patients at risk of CVD is the [Framingham Risk Calculator](https://www.mdcalc.com/framingham-coronary-heart-disease-risk-score). Risk factors include Age, Sex, Smoking status, Total and HDL cholesterol level, BP, and BP medication status. This risk calculator calculates the risk of heart attack in 10 years, and is often a very poignant statistic to share with patients.

Obesity is known to affect almost all of these modifiable risk factors - being obese is associated with poor lipid metabolism, and we know that more weight on your body will increase your blood pressure. Often, one of the first things we tell people to do when they come in with slightly elevated BP is to try to lose weight.

If anything, this study reinforces the already large amount/longstanding data that tells us that obesity is bad. Was this study important to do? Sure - it's always important to reaffirm relevance and accuracy of dated evidence.

I remember a couple years ago I was sitting at home, and I could hear this very discreet, classical music coming from somewhere. Could barely hear it. Went to go search for it but once I got up and moved I could no longer hear it. Sat back down, listened... There it is again.. And again. That experience really made me question my reality and my perception. There was no music."

"&gt; Our study revealed some stylistic biases in how articles are written, however. The largest, most prominent effects (as they relate to climate change) were reported in the upfront summary sections (also called the abstract) where they are most readily seen by readers, whereas the lesser effects and those that were not significant tended to be buried within the technical results sections where relatively few readers are likely to see them.

The author goes on to mitigate this as a less important issue, but I don't think he should.  From a pure scientific viewpoint, it isn't much of an issue.  From a public policy standpoint, this is a huge issue.

The stylistic bias feeds the news reports and the political Chicken Littles who use the most extreme models that are discussed up-front in the abstract.  This is good political fodder (short term), drives clicks in the media, and enables a story based on the worst possible scenarios.

In addition, the abstracts are often public while the papers require somebody to actually pay for them.  Couple that with a general laziness and the non-scientific community only sees the most extreme models/outcomes.

The net effect is the stylistic bias encourages skeptics to be skeptical.  Why not?  If a meteorologist only showed the most dangerous path out of all the spaghetti models when a hurricane approaches the people will quickly be skeptical of the hurricane forecasts.  The same goes for climate science and the stylistic bias.  I believe the scientific community in this discipline are doing themselves a great disservice by not getting out in front of this as well as getting out and mitigating those who sensationalize the issue."
"I am a nurse and we are monitored for our call outs.  If we have to call out for a weekend shift or a holiday we have to bring a doctors note.  More than three shifts you need to be cleared by occupational health.  We can't use sick time until we use two days in a row of vacation time.  I've been screwed over by nurses calling out, you end up taking extra patients and sometimes it can be unsafe.  I think it is ridiculous to monitor people's call outs though.  I think the only monitoring we should do is have a limit in a specific time period.  Especially with health care, some time off has nothing to do with being sick.  We have insane hours 12 and 16 hour shifts, we need breaks for mental decompression.  Also not every illness warrants a dr visit, sometimes you just need a day of bed rest.  I think the hospital should have a better plan for resource workers and back up help so people don't feel they have to kill themselves to come in, so their coworkers aren't mad at them.  The administration likes to put the blame on us when in reality they don't want to spend money making sure we have adequate coverage.  I think less people call out when you let people be adults and make their own choices about it... but like I said, if they abuse it then fire them. "
"People have long argued that some traits of psychopathy are useful, that seems to be what researchers are getting at here. At first glance, it seems like fearless dominance (the argued useful or good aspects of psychopathy) would be traits of psychopathy, not a separate kind of psychopathy. typically either a person is high enough in those traits and others to meet the criteria for psychopathy, or is high in those traits but too low in others to meet the criteria. 

what's interesting about this study, is how dimensionally it treats psychopathy, rather than than categorically. Implying you can be high enough in these benign traits to meet the criteria for psychopath, but so low in the malicious/malignant traits as to be negligible - with education serving as a mediator. although, this strikes me as an extraordinary claim. Plus, saying that ""this causes no harm to other employees/people in the workplace whatsoever"" is pretty arguable, I think. I don't have access to the full study to know how they controlled for that - be greatful to anyone that does and can explain.

But anyway, officially, psychopathy has been removed from the dsm (as i'm sure many have already pointed out) and spread out across narcisisstic personality disorder, and anti-social personality disorder, or a combination of the two, with sadistic personality disorder categorized as needing further study/under consideration for inclusion in the DSM.

That's not to say that researchers haven't used a measure of this construct that is valid and reliable or used bad science (again I can't get to the full study so I can't be sure they haven't either), but the construct itself is under debate. Little bit of a nomenclature issue.

"My wife was watching it, and so I saw portions of several episodes. It did seem to me that the show was romanticizing suicide to an alarming degree.

Make no mistake, suicide is often rationalized, at least in part, as a way to say 'fuck you,' or 'I told you so,' to the family and friends left behind. That was the whole premise of the show, basically.

The show was aimed at teens. Many teens aren't able to critically analyze something like this. Teens are highly suggestible, too. There is a real danger that when youth see someone else commit suicide, they may get the idea that they should follow that same path. There does seem to be a certain kind of 'contagious' behaviour among some youth. I think this is why suicide isn't talked about more openly. Parents fear putting ideas in their kids' immature minds."

"A lot of people seem to be pointing out exercise but the real big change is the way the youth socializes.

When I was 19, maybe 5 days out of the week I met up with friends and just hung out doing random stuff in between work and school. We went to bars clubs and parties, we met up with other groups, we explored the city and just did a whole lot of random shit. And we did it A LOT, and basically everyone did it, it was nice walking around and running into a constant stream of friends and groups. It wasn't really straight up exercise but all that walking and biking and partying kept us very active. 

Today, that social environment has mostly changed for our youth. Its still going strong in places like philly or NYC, but for many suburban areas (and yes, even some cities) kids aren't 'hanging out' nearly as much. And its a vicious cycle, a sociologist said something in an article which stuck with me, ""kids aren't going outside because there is nothing to do, and there is nothing to do because kids aren't going outside"". 

Kids WILL go outside if there is a stable fun social environment that has a lot of people interacting with each other. People playing soccer in the streets, people hanging out on stoops, parties and music blasting, groups of people their age roaming around having fun, girls to hook up with etc etc. But a lot of that stuff has died down, and so kids have stopped going out as much, which results in that stuff dying down even more. 

As such, a huge portion of our youth plays video games and goes on social media for 5-6 hours a day. Its not their fault, but a huge portion of them are insanely depressed. And its not social media or video games fault either, considering kids in NYC and other denser cities are still going out nearly [3 times as much as the national average despite having the same technology](http://i.imgur.com/0BUUOKT.png)The social trappings which kept them busy 20 years ago were originally stamped out by the broken windows policing of the 90s and 00s and also by overprotective parents, but now its really more of a vicious cycle.

I live in Korea where many people advocate sleeping in the same room and having the baby on a mat or on the floor in lieu of a crib. I'm sure it is still a problem, but we rarely hear of cases of SIDS here. Another thing common here is keeping infants fully clothed from a very early age. The final thing here is the tendency to closely monitor the temperature of the room and keep it between 24-28 degrees Celsius.

"The title says ""stronger arms"" but the research found stronger arm **bones**.

From my limited knowledge, there isn't a perfect correlation between bone density and muscle strength. The act of rowing produces relatively gradual stress fluctuations on the bones of the upper body and may not be a good example of modern ""elite"" arm (bone) strength. This is because there is next to no impact force, which may be required to induce bone density increases.

Think of the difference between someone who runs on concrete vs someone who ""runs"" on the elliptical. Both use similar muscles but the leg bone density in the outdoor runner will be significantly higher. It's possible that prehistoric women had similar or even lesser muscle strength than modern rowers but higher bone density.

3. Any cells (like DCs or Macs etc) hiding the virus would still be vulnerable to native immune attack and destruction as now the hosts immune system is restore to better viral surveillance.  

4. To prevent further mutation or expansion of some variant resistant to this new immunotherapy, some form of HAART (which then could also be lessened) could still be employed thereby hitting the virus with two-different forms of treatment: cellular + small-molecule.

"Hmm. Let's pick this apart. Fairly broad and exciting sounding claim. And some of the results are pretty good. But overall there's a misleading tone to this publication. 

&gt;We show...  holograms that can project complex full-color images, which are invariant to viewing angle. 

Sounds good. Sort of. This evokes a clear image in all of our minds of a finely featured, color, _3D_ image, at least at first. Except that's not what the authors mean. While the common concept of a hologram entails a volume projection (of a 3D object) the technical definition is a bit wider. And ""invariant to viewing angle"" is a clue. A popular culture hologram is specifically _not_ invariant to viewing angle. The view between your left eye and right eye vary (creating depth perception) and in a really nice wide frame hologram you can even move your head back and forth and ""look around"" objects. This is what's commonly meant by ""hologram"" in plain English. 

&gt;The word, hologram originates from the Greek word, holos, which means whole(1). In general, the whole refers to the ability to control phase and amplitude of a wavefront to create a desired intensity image projection.

Mmmmm uh oh. Scientists are re-defining a word everyone already thinks they know. That's not great for clarity of communication. I personally thought the ""whole"" refers to the volumetric aspect of the resulting image, which in the 3D hologram is really not at all well described as an ""intensity image"" but as a light field. This means that not only is the light at the plane of the hologram given changes to intensity, but also is structured in the direction that it propagates. That's how 3D holograms work. By structuring the light so that it has the proper intensity _and direction_ to pass through the image region and arrive at your eye as if it has originated from the image object, reflections, occlusions, translucency, and everything else replicated. 

&gt;Figure 2(f) shows the photograph of the image projected onto an opaque white screen (see Fig. S2(b) for details). Note that the photograph was taken at an oblique viewing angle illustrating that the image quality is maintained for a large range of viewing angles. 


Ok so if you read the article this far it was plainly clear by this point that the authors did not present a device that could project a 3D hologram. What they presented was a device that projects a 2D image onto a surface without the use of a lens or source image, using only a collimated beam of light and their patterned transparent surface. What this _is_ is a diffractive optical element, or a holographic optical element. What it is _not_ is a holographic image, aka ""hologram"". The ""gram"" in hologram is referring to ""written or marked,"" same as a photo_graph_ [according to the etymology source everyone other than the authors uses](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hologram), and incidentally the authors of the etymology contend that the ""holo"" refers specifically to the 3D part. 

And finally let's just tackle this ""viewing angle"" claim. The last quote of the publication I included makes clear that what's invariant is _what you see when you view the projection of this element on a white friggin' opaque or translucent screen_.

Well, _yes_. Yes, that's what happens when you project something onto a white screen. It can be seen from any direction. And that property is 100% due to the screen, not the diffractive optical element. 

So this is very much not a hologram in a way that's meaningful to most of us. In fact the authors had to painfully redefine the word ""hologram"" to make it a hologram. The results are actually really good for a sub megapixel DOE operating with continuum illumination, compared to other stuff I've read where monochromatic illumination is required and there's just as much intensity noise. And the required features sound modest and easy to fabricate. I would have liked to see the color rendering with a trichromatic illumination rather than continuum just so we could see how good the rendering might really get. A typical 3CCD dichroic combined based- or even color wheel based- computer projector seems like it would have worked although I don't know for sure. 

But _CRAP_ folks, scientists are supposed to uphold a higher standard of truth, not build their own little castles of truth inaccessible to the general public. When you have to redefine plain English to communicate a concept that's really not all that complicated, you done wrong. 

TL;DR: **NOT AT ALL A HOLOGRAM**. At least not like you were probably thinking. "

A Large-Scale Test of the Goldilocks Hypothesis
Quantifying the Relations Between Digital-Screen Use and the Mental Well-Being of Adolescents

Abstract

&gt; Although the time adolescents spend with digital technologies has sparked widespread concerns that their use might be negatively associated with mental well-being, these potential deleterious influences have not been rigorously studied. Using a preregistered plan for analyzing data collected from a representative sample of English adolescents (n = 120,115), we obtained evidence that the links between digital-screen time and mental well-being are described by quadratic functions. Further, our results showed that these links vary as a function of when digital technologies are used (i.e., weekday vs. weekend), suggesting that a full understanding of the impact of these recreational activities will require examining their functionality among other daily pursuits. Overall, the evidence indicated that moderate use of digital technology is not intrinsically harmful and may be advantageous in a connected world. The findings inform recommendations for limiting adolescents' technology use and provide a template for conducting rigorous investigations into the relations between digital technology and children's and adolescents' health."

"Just for clarity, this doesn't mean that they have identified the genes responsible for causing depression. They've only found markers to look for to see if someone is pre-disposed. 

Often these markers have absolutely nothing to do with the actual disease itself, they're just close enough to the gene of interest that they remain together through chromosome rearrangement. If they can find these markers, it helps narrow down the search for what is actually causing depression, and helps with determining one's risk-level. "

Just because a finding makes you say ""No shit"" does not mean that the research question guiding the study was stupid. Many, many studies have found counter-intuitive findings that researchers did not predict, but are later shown to be true. These redefine how we consider human thought and behavior.

Intuitive findings are still important though. Without these seemingly 'basic' studies, we can not be so sure. Don't disparage research just because you think you already knew the results."

&gt; Being highly active was associated with even greater benefits: people who spent more than 750 minutes walking briskly each week reduced their risk of premature death by 36 per cent.

If quintupling the amount of exercise you get reduces the relative risk of death by only an additional 8%, it sounds like most of what's going on here is a selection effect, unless getting a small amount of exercise matters about a dozen times more than additional exercise past that point, which seems like too large of a difference."
"The term ""right wing authoritarian"" was coined by Bob Altemeyer, and explained in his book The Authoritarians. 

It doesn't mean what you think it means.


&gt; Because the submission occurs to traditional authority, I call these followers right- wing authoritarians. I'm using the word ""right"" in one of its earliest meanings, for in Old English ""riht"" (pronounced ""writ"") as an adjective meant lawful, proper, correct, doing what the authorities said. (And when someone did the lawful thing back then, maybe the authorities said, with a John Wayne drawl, ""You got that riht, pilgrim!"") 

&gt; In North America people who submit to the established authorities to extraordinary degrees often turn out to be political conservatives, so you can call them ""right-wingers"" both in my new-fangled psychological sense and in the usual political sense as well. But someone who lived in a country long ruled by Communists and who ardently supported the Communist Party would also be one of my psychological right-wing authoritarians even though we would also say he was a political left-winger. So a right-wing authoritarian follower doesn't necessarily have conservative political views. Instead he's someone who readily submits to the established authorities in society, attacks others in their name, and is highly conventional. It's an aspect of his personality, not a description of his politics. Right-wing authoritarianism is a personality trait, like being characteristically bashful or happy or grumpy or dopey.

Abstract: 

&gt; Previous research has established a link between testosterone concentrations in males and their mating effort as it relates to their mate seeking behaviors. However, very little research has analyzed how variability in basal testosterone concentration of males affects their mating effort once they have secured a romantic partner. In a sample of undergraduate men, the relationship between testosterone, intrasexual competitiveness, and mate retention behavior was examined. Results showed that higher basal testosterone predicted more self-reported mate retention effort. This relationship was mediated by intrasexual competitiveness, such that high T men reported more intrasexual competitiveness, which when included in the model predicted mate retention, and reduced the initial T - mate retention relationship to statistical non-significance. When examined separately, this mediation effect applied specifically to cost-inflicting, rather than benefit-provisioning, mate retention behavior. These are the first findings to link T to mate retention effort and to identify intrasexual competitiveness as a mechanism which might account for this relationship."

&gt; In Study 2, we utilized the random coin outcome sequences that we tested in Study 1 to manipulate pattern search. In order to guess the next coin outcome following each sequence, participants either were, or were not, instructed to look for patterns in the coin tosses. As the cognitive process of pattern perception tends to occur particularly when people predict uncertain outcomes (Gilovich et al., 1985; Wilke et al.,2014), we reasoned that intuitively searching for patterns in random sequences as a means to guess the next coin toss would increase the likelihood of people perceiving patterns in the coin toss sequences. **We therefore predicted that searching for patterns in random sequences would increase irrational beliefs through an increase in pattern perception.**

But is this based solely on information that is presented to the observer through, say, mainstream media outlets or the **totality** of information from all available sources? 

If you were to watch cable news and see a mass casualty incident (and its accompanying narrative) and immediately question its validity because you instantly sense ""patterns"" in the information, then this may indeed be illogical. But if you were to learn of this event and subsequently performed your own comprehensive research through a variety of sources that you yourself vetted and could reasonably assume to be largely accurate, and then after examining the totality of the data, information, narratives, and extenuating circumstances, you conclude the patterns exist that would imply there may be a ""conspiracy"" afoot, is that illogical?

Artemisia annua dried leaf tablets treated malaria resistant to ACT and i.v. artesunate: case reports. 

Phytomedicine, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1016/j.phymed.2017.04.006

Abstract

&gt; Background
&gt; Dried leaf Artemisia annua (DLA) has shown efficacy against Plasmodium sp. in rodent studies and in small clinical trials. Rodent malaria also showed resiliency against the evolution of artemisinin drug resistance.

&gt; Purpose
&gt; This is a case report of a last resort treatment of patients with severe malaria who were responding neither to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) nor i.v. artesunate.

&gt; Study Design
&gt; Of many patients treated with ACTs and i.v. artesunate during the 6 mon study period, 18 did not respond and were subsequently treated with DLA Artemisia annua.

&gt; Methods
&gt; Patients were given a dose of 0.5 g DLA per os, twice daily for 5d. Total adult delivered dose of artemisinin was 55 mg. Dose was reduced for body weight under 30 kg. Clinical symptoms, e.g. fever, coma etc., and parasite levels in thick blood smears were tracked. Patients were declared cured and released from hospital when parasites were microscopically undetectable and clinical symptoms fully subsided.

&gt; Results
&gt; All patients were previously treated with Coartem® provided through Santé Rurale (SANRU) and following the regimen prescribed by WHO. Of 18 ACT-resistant severe malaria cases compassionately treated with DLA, all fully recovered. Of the 18, this report details two pediatric cases.

&gt; Conclusions
&gt; Successful treatment of all 18 ACT-resistant cases suggests that DLA should be rapidly incorporated into the antimalarial regimen for Africa and possibly wherever else ACT resistance has emerged.

EDIT:

For the commenters saying that this is not new because Artemisinin, the drug used in Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), is derived from Artemisia annua, the issue here is resistance to Artemisinin combination therapy, and the fact that the dried natural leaves of the Artemisia plant appear to have overcome this. 

This suggests that there may be something else in the natural leaves of the Artemisia plant that is more than just pure Artemisinin.

From the linked university press release article:

&gt; Weathers says the superior performance of DLA in comparison to ACT, as well as its ability to kill drug-resistant parasites and avoid the resistance trap, itself, is likely due to the synergistic effects of a complex array of phytochemicals contained in the plant's leaves, several of which are also known to have antimalarial properties and others of which may act both to enhance the absorption of artemisinin into the bloodstream and bolster its effectiveness against malaria. In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs.

It's fascinating stuff. "

We've received anecdotal comments from married people who say they can name somebody else they'd likely end up with in case their spouse died. So we definitely want to explore this issue with older individuals and those in long-term relationships.""

This seems to be a caveat with lots of behavioral studies. The study participants are primarily college-aged, sometimes wholly from within the Psych/Socio department. It's difficult to extrapolate the behavior of a very narrow, transitional population to the population as a whole."

"This ""study"" didn't have a control group. Participants were split into three groups; group 1 received a low dose, group 2 a medium, and group 3 a high dose. All three groups received psilocybin, immediately after which they took part in a spiritual wellness retreat of some kind over a 6 month period. There was no control group to assess whether having no psilocybin whatsoever might produce the same results under the same conditions. 

The study claims that participants were randomized in a double-blind experiment, which would prevent both subjects and observers from knowing their group and anticipating results. But it also goes on to mention that subjects who took a high dosage received ""high support for spiritual practice"" while the others received ""standard"" support, with the acronym likely ""low"" support for spiritual practice. This may have confounded the variables by 1) changing the degree of non-psilocybin factors that may increase positive personality or behavioral changes, and 2) making both subjects and observers aware of which group was which, changing their behavior during the trial.

The premise is interesting, but are the methods rigorous and the findings viable? To me it looks like meditating regularly with like-minded people for six months could bring about lasting psychological changes. Unfortunately we can't confirm whether or not that is true here, because we have no data from participants that just did the spiritual support without the drug. "
"But we know from geology when the oxygenation event took place. Huge layers of banded ironstone were laid down as ferrous iron oxidised to ferric oxide, and precipitated out of solution. This is called the Siderian age, after the ironstone deposits, and date to around 2.45 billion years ago . Other geological, isotopic, and chemical evidence supports this date. Cyanobacteria appeared in the ocean about 200 million years earlier, and are thought to be the primary source of the oxygen.

"This is extra-interesting to me because Auditory testing is how my DH's brain injury and seizures got initially diagnosed (around 1994, along with a whiplash from a car accident) with a ""BrainStem-Auditory-Evoked-Response Test"" (BAER) where they hooked electrodes to his skull and put headphones on him with special sequences of sounds, and they measured his brain's response to noises --- which proved that his ""Auditory responses"" were messed-up and thus they thought that he was having unusual Temporal Lobe seizures that were probably being triggered by certain kinds of noise more than by the more-typical epilepsy triggered by lights. Further testing including EEGs and brain MRIs helped confirm the seizure and brain-injury diagnoses, and seizure meds helped stop the seizures. 

In his case, one problem that his Brainstem-response test showed was that one side of his brain was delaying the sound-response compared to the other side, which confuses the brain... and one of the ""waves"" in the normal wave-pattern cycles that happen during the brain's responses to noise was completely missing all the time during the tests (which were done over 20 years ago at the cutting-edge Darthmouth-Hitchcock Hospital Audiology Clinic in New Hampshire, which was studying these issues for mostly pediatric cases at that time, iirc.)

Abstract

Sacoglossan sea slugs offer fascinating systems to study the onset and persistence of algal-plastid symbioses. Elysia chlorotica is particularly noteworthy because it can survive for months, relying solely on energy produced by ingested plastids of the stramenopile alga Vaucheria litorea that are sequestered in cells lining its digestive diverticula. How this animal can maintain the actively photosynthesizing organelles without replenishment of proteins from the lost algal nucleus remains unknown. Here, we used RNA-Seq analysis to test the idea that plastid sequestration leaves a significant signature on host gene expression during E. chlorotica development. Our results support this hypothesis and show that upon exposure to and ingestion of V. litorea plastids, genes involved in microbe-associated molecular patterns and oxidative stress-response mechanisms are significantly up-regulated. Interestingly, our results with E. chlorotica mirror those found with corals that maintain dinoflagellates as intact cells in symbiosomes, suggesting parallels between these animal-algal symbiotic interactions."

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Increasing surface temperatures, Arctic sea-ice loss, and other evidence of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) are acknowledged by every major scientific organization in the world. However, there is a wide gap between this broad scientific consensus and public opinion. Internet blogs have strongly contributed to this consensus gap by fomenting misunderstandings of AGW causes and consequences. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) have become a ""poster species"" for AGW, making them a target of those denying AGW evidence. Here, focusing on Arctic sea ice and polar bears, we show that blogs that deny or downplay AGW disregard the overwhelming scientific evidence of Arctic sea-ice loss and polar bear vulnerability. By denying the impacts of AGW on polar bears, bloggers aim to cast doubt on other established ecological consequences of AGW, aggravating the consensus gap. To counter misinformation and reduce this gap, scientists should directly engage the public in the media and blogosphere."

"Here's a TLDR version for everyone.  Most of this is copied from the actual paper.  I didn't write this.

It's not a meta, it's six original studies.  Although I think this kind of stuff is incredibly obvious and not very interesting.  

Here we go:

First they re-analyzed an existing dataset.
The psychological entitlement scale (PES; Campbell et al. 2004) was completed before or after dinner to test the effect of hunger on entitlement.  Hunger and entitlement correlate at r = .21.  Apparently, they collected this data for another purpose but noticed that hungry people ignored isntructions.

The PES is composed of these 9 items rated on a scale of 1(strongly disagree) to 7(strongly agree):

1. I honestly feel I'm just more deserving than others. 
2. Great things should come to me. 
3. If I were on the Titanic, I would deserve to be on the first lifeboat! 
4. I demand the best because I'm worth it. 
5. I do not necessarily deserve special treatment. 
6. I deserve more things in my life. 
7. People like me deserve an extra break now and then. 
8. Things should go my way. 
9. I feel entitled to more of everything
 

Study 1
Ps first complete the PES and the ten item personality inventory (TIPI; rating whether 10 personality characteristics like warm and sympathetic describe them; Gosling et al., 2003).  Finally, participants were asked to complete a word search according to a set of specific instructions (find words in a certain orientation, list five total words, find words of at least three letters, find distinct words, type words in all capital letters, put a semicolon and space in between the words, and put a period after the last word). We summed the total number of instructions (out of seven) they ignored.  Entitlement correlated with the number of instructions that were ignored, r = .14, p = .040.

Study 2
The goal of Study 2 was to explore whether entitled people are more likely to ignore instructions because they do not want to inconvenience themselves (i.e., because they are selfish).
Ps complete the PES and TIPI again.  
Participants respond to 13 hypothetical scenarios in which they imagined being given instructions by another person. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions in which it was either higher or lower cost for them to follow instructions in each scenario. For each scenario, participants rated how likely they would be to not follow instructions.
Entitlement predicted ignoring instructions, (B = .287, p &lt; .001) while controlling for high/low cost condition (B = .130, p = .045).  Condition and entitlement did not interact, B = -.07, p = .259.

Study 3.
In this study, we examined whether entitled people are less likely to follow instructions because they are especially averse to being controlled by others. 
They first completed the PES and TIPI, as in previous studies. Then, participants were told that they would be asked to complete a word search on the next screen according to specific instructions. They were either told that following instructions was mandatory (and that they would be punished by losing out on a 10-cent bonus for failing to follow instructions) or optional (and that they would be rewarded with an additional 10-cent bonus for following instructions). Finally, they were given a word search similar to the one used in Study 1. They summed the number of instructions they ignored again.  
Same as in Study 2, Instructions were more likely to be ignored when the recipients of the instructions were more entitled and when following instructions was framed as optional.

Study 4.
In Study 4, we examined whether entitled people are more likely to ignore instructions because they think they are unlikely to be punished for doing so.  This study does not provide evidence for the hypothesis that entitled people ignore instructions simply because they think they can avoid punishment, so I'll skip it. 

Study 5
In this study, we took a brief detour to learn whether entitled people are particularly sensitive to potentially unfair situations and willing to protest the unfairness even in ways that might hurt themselves. To do this, we asked participants to respond to ultimatum game offers

Ps complete the PES and TIPI again.  Then, participants were told to imagine that they were playing a game with another MTurk worker and that the other person was the ""proposer"" and they were the ""responders."" Participants read the following: ""The proposer has to come up with an offer to propose to you that states how much of $10 to allocate to himself or herself and how much to give to you. You can either accept the offer, which means that you and your partner will both get the proposed amounts, or you can reject the offer, in which case neither of you gets paid anything."" Similar to what has been done in other research (e.g., Koenigs &amp; Tranel, 2007), participants were then presented with a series of hypothetical offers, one at a time in random order, where the proposer suggested the following allocations: $10/$0, $9/$1, $8/$2, $7/3, $6/4, and $5/5. Participants indicated whether they would accept or reject each offer.
 Surprise:  Entitled people, who believe they deserve more than others, are more likely to reject potentially unfair offers in an ultimatum game. They seemingly would rather take a loss themselves than agree to an offer that does not reflect their worth.

The final study just presents a mediation model.  But meh.  Essentially, entitled people don't follow instructions because they don't think it's fair to them.  The indirect effect through a fairness scale is significant.

"I do not know much about lab grown meat but I find the idea very interesting as I'm a chef by trade. My question is, will we have the ability to grow specific cuts like brisket and beef ribs or will it just be more of a ground beef product? If so will they be able to get to the point of being marbled like a cut of wagyu and if so  do you see it increasing the overall quality of beef available?"
There was an AMA a while ago by a guy who became wealthy making apps. He said something that has stuck with me and is a goal I hope to reach soon. He said the biggest change in his life when he got rich was that his concern shifted from paying bills/sustaining himself to focusing on how he spends his time. That would be the most freeing existence I can think of.

The scientists now want to investigate more closely what the links are between the DNA and social phobia. ""In order to achieve this goal, we need many more study participants who suffer from social anxiety,"" says the psychologist and study coordinator Stefanie Rambau from the Clinic and Policlinic for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy at University Hospital Bonn. Information about the study is available at http://www.SocialPhobiaResearch.de. ""Those who take part will help to research social phobia. This is the basis of better diagnosis and treatment procedures in the future,"" says Stefanie Rambau."
"""Patients with ASD often exhibit abnormal responses in sensory regions of the brain, and the RIKEN scientists found similar abnormalities in the brain region of the model mice that detects whisker movement. Although specific whisker movements are normally tightly mapped across this brain region, calcium imaging showed that a given whisker movement activated a much larger region of sensory cortex in the ASD model mice. This means that the responses of neighboring regions were more overlapped, which reduces the ability to distinguish sensations.""

...

""These findings indicated an abnormality in cortical excitatory/inhibitory balance. First author Nobuhiro Nakai notes, ""Because the sensory region was receiving abnormally low serotonin input, we reasoned that giving infant mice serotonin therapy might reduce the imbalance and also rescue some of the behavioral abnormalities.""
To test this hypothesis, the team administered a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, commonly referred to as an SSRI, to infant mice during the first three weeks after birth. This time period corresponded to the time period in which reduced serotonin was observed in the model mice. Researchers found that sensory neurons in the model mice treated with the SSRI showed more normal inhibitory responses, which improved the excitatory/inhibitory balance.

They also found that this intervention improved the social behavior of the model mice in adulthood.""


I'm jel, but I'm also not because SSRI's are why I lost my mind  and became extremely violent on them when I was a preteen/ teenager. Sounds like there's a time and place where SSRI's can be appropriate, but if the brain structure's already so damaged, it seems to be more of a detriment than a help. Not only that though, think about the potential side effects if this was common practice for people like me [Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in pregnancy and infant outcomes](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/SSRI-infant-outcomes)"

"I work creating storm water models for different watersheds to assess flooding for existing and future conditions. Problems like this occur much more frequently than people realize on a smaller scale. Many times the introduction of a housing development upstream of even a small tributary can cause flooding and housing damage to a community only slightly further downstream. 

The company I work focuses primarily on managing storm water programs for local cities with green infrastructure practices. In most cases, implementing a natural solution such as a detention basin, pond, or replanting the floodplains with specific plants is enough to resolve a problem. These practices are generally cheaper as well.

"I'm a guy in the USA with diagnosed bipolar 1 and ptsd. Psychiatric service animals are beginning to be used more here in a more primary role. For me my dog is a life saver.

 My mental health is stable and whatnot after years of tuning treatment. Yet, keeping a regular schedule and eating regularly is something I have never been good at. Bipolar for me and many others is the fight for staying stable and regular, not missing a dose of medicine and sleeping in a consistent manner. So basically my dog reminds me to be human, and then also when ptsd attacks occur she will distract me. 

What I'm curious about is the legal identifications for psych service dogs in the U.K.  In the USA I can legally be asked what service does my dog provide, and this is more nuanced than people like at times.

"Just to point out, but what this is saying is the bird model they have is fairly simple and uses simple proportional navigation (you keep the heading angle to the target constant and you will intercept).

If that's correct, then insulin blockers would allow you to eat and maintain these states. However, you could achieve the same states simply by fasting for certain periods of time, like fasting a couple days a week, or even just eating one meal per day or similar.

I'll try to make it as easy to understand as possible. Their testing methods weren't  [testing methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15611#s1). They literally just did a model (Formula) based on population, production per country/inhabitant, and a magical rate they made up, without having to go to these rivers and test their MPW (mismanaged plastic waste) as seen last paragraph of the introduction.

What they essentially did was test rivers for MPW, and plugged in the population density, and production, and then applied it to rivers they thought would be high in MPW. Here are the rivers they used for their model.

- Danube x2 (europe)

- Danube/Rhine 4x (europe)

- Po 2x (europe)

- sein 1x (europe)

- Yangtze 1x (Asia)

- ~~Rech~~ Elqui, Maipo, Biobio, Maule, 4x (South America)

- ~~Yonko~~ Patapsco, Magothy, Rhode, Corsica, 16x (North America) 

They're trying to test how polluted a country's river can be yet they only have 1/30 of the rivers are from Asia. hrmm..

This is how accurate their model is as reported by them under ""Results"" under Table 3.

Pearson product-moment test, r=0.4132, P&lt;0.05, n=29).

If you haven't take statistics in a while here is what the variables mean

r= correlation factor, scale -1 - 1, 1 most correlated, &lt;.7 is considered strong correlation 

n= number of samples

P=how valid their hypothesis is, scale 0 - 1: &lt;.05 not valid, &gt;.05 valid. 

Their hypothesis: ""We predict a global annual input of plastic from rivers into the oceans ranging from 1.15 to 2.41 million tonnes with a dominant contribution from rivers of the Asian continent.""

So they themselves know their model is not very accurate due to their P value, especially with a .41 correlation. Also did you notice the model is out of 29 samples instead of the 30? The one example they had to throw out because it was an outlier, can you guess which one? yep the only Asian river sample.

So the fact they haven't even used any sampling from any Asian countries with rivers they still use a model FOR those countries. The fact it's a model and not an actual experiment is also never mentioned in the article. 

Though it still may be true that the Yangtze river may cause lots of plastic pollution, there was no actual experiment done, or **GOOD** model to base this off of. It would be like if I took samples of food in Sedona, beufort, Newport, Asheville (All USA), and Munich (Germany) made a model of how many calories they had, then threw away the sample from Munich, and applied my model all over Europe. Would my ""model"" be accurate?

**TL;DR** There was actually no experiment, just a model, the findings are most likely wrong b/c they say so themselves through their model, and bad samples."

That article is a little older, but it highlights the problem in OP's article. No one is counting 10's of millions of sperm per milliliter by hand. The technology to do this has ""substantially improved"", and the WHO has changed how to interpret this data twice. (Since the 1920's, and it didn't say the exact years.) So, the data today may be much more accurate, but it's hard to compare that to counts from 50 or even 20 years ago."

IE when a child confesses (I broke the vase) a punishment is an immediate punishment for honesty and delayed punishment for breaking the vase, ie strong subconscious association and weak conscious association. This isn't an issue for immediate punishment (brother hit sister and instantly punished).

Would it be better to acknowledge the honesty and delay the punishment so there is no association with the honesty? IE get home from work, child confesses::isn't punished, but is punished much later (at night or maybe the next day)."

Even further, stressful events are perceived as more punishing due to a decreased expectation of privacy.

&gt;RESULTS:

&gt;During a mean follow-up of 5.4 years, obese individuals with no metabolic abnormalities had a higher risk of CHD (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45 to 1.54), cerebrovascular disease (HR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.11), and heart failure (HR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.86 to 2.06) compared with normal weight individuals with 0 metabolic abnormalities. Risk of CHD, cerebrovascular disease, and heart failure in normal weight, overweight, and obese individuals increased with increasing number of metabolic abnormalities.

&gt;CONCLUSIONS:

&gt;Metabolically healthy obese individuals had a higher risk of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and heart failure than normal weight metabolically healthy individuals. Even individuals who are normal weight can have metabolic abnormalities and similar risks for cardiovascular disease events.

"For me it's less about me confirming to gender expectations for myself and more about meeting her gender expectations. 

Turning down sex looks like a huge red flag to women. Gender expectations say that if he's not interested that means he's already had sex and is spent(infidelity), or he's mad at you. My current SO went the latter route when she last initiated sex and I turned her down because I was tired, sore, and not in the mood to do push ups on top of her. 

My previous SO would get upset if I didn't orgasm during intercourse, and that happened quite often. I would power through to the point of exhaustion and go limp. That's not to say I didn't still enjoy every second of it. I didn't feel I needed the orgasm to make it ""good"". She didn't share my feelings on it. 

It's tough to turn it down with a close lover when you know it can be interpreted as some kind of petty move or a sign of infidelity. Often it's easier to go through the motions than deal with the drama. 

Not something I have to worry about anymore. Haven't had sex in over a year and the dry spell doesn't look to be ending any time soon. Doh.  "

"A few facts about the 2014 Mexican soda tax.  Sources: Euromonitor, Canadean, BMJ, Mexican National Institute of Public health.

- That 6% number comes from a study that was done in 2015, and only tells you what happened in 2014 itself - the year the tax went into effect
- Carbonated soft drinks (e.g. Coke) declined only 1.7%
- The main hit was on non-carbonated sweetened beverages (declined 17%) - stuff like juice, gatorade, etc.
- Total demand for soft drinks was back to 2013 levels by 2016.  Growth trajectory for soft drinks resumed previous trend as soon as 2015
- Diet soft drinks got an immediate boost in 2014 (though they are still a small part of the market)
- Lots of people seemed to switch to smaller pack sizes (e.g. 12oz cans instead of liter bottles), because the tax was imposed on a per-liter basis.  So rather than buy big bottles, people bought more, small cans, because the price of each can went up less.
- I'm not sure what happened to non-carbonated sugary beverages past 2014, but I believe they kept growing despite the tax

So what did we learn?

- The Mexican government loves to tout this as a win, though the lasting effect is pretty unclear
- The effect was very short lived on many types of beverages, including soda
- This didn't really affect Coke or Pepsi much at all, since soda drinkers seemed to either keep drinking it, switch to cans, or buy diet soda.  What it did do was kill off competition from other beverage types.
- People who are very price sensitive down to the centavo (likely poorer people) seemed to switch to packages with less expensive taxes imposed, though it's not clear their total consumption declined

So I'm not sure what to say about this tax.  I don't think you can really call it a win for public health, because the lasting effect is not really clear.  People certainly aren't drinking any less soda, but they are probably drinking a bit less other sugary drinks like juice.  I'm a bit concerned that this was sort of a regressive tax whose burden fell heavily on poor people.

That said, I'm personally all for taxing vice.  But as with everything, the truth on the ground is way more complicated than the theory."

In other words, it *appears* that the data the study gathered was whether the free lyft rides were used - not whether the people made it to their appointments via other modes of transit. Am I misreading this?  The full text of the study appears to be behind a paywall 

Edit: Someone has pointed out a correct reading of the article. The study was not simply tracking who used the free Lyft and who did not; they tracked who missed their appointments. So when the article mentions that the study did not ask how participants got to their appointments if they did not use Lyft, this is referring *exclusively* to the group of participants who did *not* miss their appointments. So the people who attended their appointments and also refused the free Lyft ride - the study did not ask how they got there.

"My summary:

Plimpton 322 describes the shapes of right-angle triangles using a novel kind of trigonometry based on ratios, not angles and circles.

The tablet not only contains the world's oldest trigonometric table; it is also the only completely accurate trigonometric table, because of the very different Babylonian approach to arithmetic and geometry.

A trigonometric table allows you to use one known ratio of the sides of a right-angle triangle to determine the other two unknown ratios.

The Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who lived about 120 years BC, has long been regarded as the father of trigonometry, with his ""table of chords"" on a circle considered the oldest trigonometric table.

""Plimpton 322 predates Hipparchus by more than 1,000 years,"" says Dr Wildberger. ""It opens up new possibilities not just for modern mathematics research, but also for mathematics education. With Plimpton 322 we see a simpler, more accurate trigonometry that has clear advantages over our own."

Will plaque build-up increase? Or will the basic laws of concentration mean that we will defecate loads of fatty feces?

The fatty feces is associated with arrested peristaltic bowl-movements and development of pockets in the cell-wall where feces is retained. This can lead to a quick death or a constant infection response as well as pain and other problems.

That's an obvious correlation.

"In grad school I was working on a mapping project for ringed seals, one of the primary foods of polar bears, and read a lot of articles on polar bears.

A common claim by global warming deniers when it comes to polar bears is that the populations can't possibly be in trouble, in fact they must be increasing because they've been seen more often by people and in areas that they were rarely seen in before.

What's been happening is that the sea and shore ice necessary for their survival, especially during critical feeding times, such as when the ringed seals are having their babies, isn't there and the bears are ranging further for food.  One of the places the bears have found they can get food is near humans and human settlements.

This results in a greater number of sightings and a mis-interpretation that the numbers are on the rise, when the greater number of sightings is actually a result of increasing survival difficulties the bears are facing.

&gt;Research has also shown that teachers exert influence on children's peer relationships (Hughes et al., 2001) by providing social cues about how likeable a peer is (Hughes et al., 2001; Farmer et al., 2011). The teacher's prominent visible role in the classroom provides extensive opportunities for students to observe exchanges with classmates, and to develop ideas about those who are liked and disliked, which then influences their own affective evaluations (Hughes et al., 2001, 2014). In accordance with social referencing theory, Hughes et al. (2001, 2014) found that students reported liking classmates who they viewed as having a positive relationship with the teacher, and disliking those they observed to be conflictual. Their findings emphasize the significant role the teacher plays in serving as a socializing agent who can significantly influence children's social relationships with peers.

This right here is the root of it.

At first, the other children (boys and girls alike) found my behavior amusing, entertaining. Once the teachers started dropping the hammer for disruption though things began to change. Whether it be because the kids were following role or simply because they were afraid that they too would get in trouble for condoning my behavior, they began to turn on me. Now the majority of my classrooms were totally against me. Whether I was joking around or not didn't matter. I was always wrong. Fast forward a bit. Imagine what it is like to be considered the ""trouble maker"". The feeling of going into new classrooms and meeting new teachers who already know your name and figure they already have you clocked is indescribable. The only way this is possible is for teachers to be in a room together and talk shit about you. It just feeds the behavior more and exacerbates it. It's not long before you become ""the example"". It's starts to feel like everyone is against you. Fuck it. It doesn't matter if you don't like me because I don't care to like you. A self planted seed that grows rapidly. By the time I got to high school my not giving a fuck was way over-tuned. It was at a point of giving what was expected. I would go out of my way to cause disruption and unruliness. Naturally, this attracted the attention of the ""wrong crowd"". A circle of clowns with me as the ring leader. I was completely desensitized to punishment at this point and I was more than willing to take the fall for the things that other people would do. Seemingly like keeping up a reputation but in actuality it was me trying to piss off people more than I was. Once everyone was conditioned to my final form I used it for my personal entertainment. I became a bully. I was a different breed of bully though. Everyone was fair game. Completely non-discriminatory. Someone laughs about something I did to one person and they were next on the list. It didn't matter who you were or what circle you ran with. If you weren't with me I was against you. This included teachers. I was a full blown menace with a heavy drug habit and a ""fuck you"" attitude. I also had a 2.fuck GPA. Obviously higher education wasn't on my to do list. Even if I could get into a school, my perception of faculty and peers was totally skewed. Who could convince me otherwise? The ones who had spent the last 12 years berating me? This behavior stayed with me well into my twenties. It took two gran mal seizures and a felony charge for me to curb my anger and change how I looked at the world. I'm 36 years old now and I still have to struggle day to day just to keep a foundation. I just wanted to make people laugh."

"This is interesting. I've often asked people who are bilingual in English and Japanese, because my studies have related to both for years now, which language they prefer... they always answered English. But then I thought that maybe that's just because I'm asking the question in English. Like, if I asked them in Japanese would they answer differently?

I have a suspicion that they would. My linguistics professor from when I studied abroad in Tokyo talked about how he asked someone in English if she was good at doing [insert thing here] and she replied ""Yeah, pretty good."" But when asked the same question in Japanese her response was ""No, no. I have a long way to go and I'm terrible at it."" She didn't even realize that she had answered them differently. In Japan, you always answer questions like that modestly so often times if you tell people who are really good at something that they're amazing at it they will deny it.

"Really interesting article, and definitely an issue that could benefit from more attention. A couple of thoughts and questions, after reading through it:

- The author, Carey, has a bit of a reputation for attacking psychiatry in the NYT. Consistent with that, the 'many' in the title, is a bit of a weasel word that does a poor job actually describing the breadth of the problem.

- I'd be interested to know to what extent the problem is potentiated by the chain of care. Are the drugs being prescribed by primary care docs who don't have the bandwidth to help patients taper down dosage as they go off the drug?

- The molecular mechanism of action? How much of the withdrawal is just the unmasking of a symptom covered by the drug? How much is due to true ""withdrawal"" tox?

The *Lancet Psychiatry* article, [Effectiveness of preventive cognitive therapy while tapering antidepressants versus maintenance antidepressant treatment versus their combination in prevention of depressive relapse or recurrence (DRD study): a three-group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036618301287)

&gt; *Background*: Keeping individuals on antidepressants after remission or recovery of major depressive disorder is a common strategy to prevent relapse or recurrence. Preventive cognitive therapy (PCT) has been proposed as an alternative to maintenance antidepressant treatment, but whether its addition would allow tapering of antidepressants or enhance the efficacy of maintenance antidepressant treatment is unclear. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of antidepressants alone, with PCT while tapering off antidepressants, or PCT added to antidepressants in the prevention of relapse and recurrence.

&gt; *Methods*: In this single-blind, multicentre, parallel, three-group, randomised controlled trial, individuals recruited by general practitioners, pharmacists, secondary mental health care, or media were randomly assigned (10:10:8) to PCT and antidepressants, antidepressants alone, or PCT with tapering of antidepressants, using computer-generated randomised allocation stratified for number of previous depressive episodes and type of care. Eligible participants had previously experienced at least two depressive episodes and were in remission or recovery on antidepressants, which they had been receiving for at least the past 6 months. Exclusion criteria were current mania or hypomania, a history of bipolar disorder, any history of psychosis, current alcohol or drug abuse, an anxiety disorder that requires treatment, psychological treatment more than twice a month, and a diagnosis of organic brain damage. The primary outcome was time-related proportion of individuals with depressive relapse or recurrence in the intention-to-treat population, assessed four times in 24 months. Assessors were masked to treatment allocation, whereas physicians and participants could not be masked. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, number NTR1907.

&gt; *Findings*: Between July 14, 2009, and April 30, 2015, 2486 participants were assessed for eligibility and 289 were randomly assigned to PCT and antidepressant (n=104), antidepressant alone (n=100), or PCT with tapering of antidepressant (n=85). The overall log-rank test was significant (p=0·014). Antidepressants alone were not superior to PCT while tapering off antidepressants in terms of the risk of relapse or recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 0·86, 95% CI 0·56-1·32; p=0·502). Adding PCT to antidepressant treatment resulted in a 41% relative risk reduction compared with antidepressants alone (0·59, 0·38-0·94; p=0·026). There were two suicide attempts (one in the antidepressants alone group and one in the PCT with tapering of antidepressants group) and one death (in the PCT and antidepressants group) not related to the interventions during the 24 months' follow-up.

&gt; *Interpretation*: Maintenance antidepressant treatment is not superior to PCT after recovery, whereas adding PCT to antidepressant treatment after recovery is superior to antidepressants alone.

"The quick and dirty version:

&gt;**Why was this study done?**

Several governmental and nongovernmental databases track the number of law-enforcement-related deaths in the US, but all are likely to undercount these deaths.To our knowledge, our study is the first to estimate the proportion of law-enforcement-related deaths properly captured by 2 data sources: official US mortality data, derived from death certificates, and The Counted, a nongovernmental database derived from news media reports.US mortality data include virtually all deaths that occur in the country, and law-enforcement-related deaths are supposed to be assigned a diagnostic code corresponding to ""legal intervention."" If a death is improperly assigned another code, it is considered to be misclassified, which leads to undercounting of the number of law-enforcement-related deaths. We investigated the extent of misclassification and the factors associated with misclassification.

&gt;**What did the researchers do and find?**

&gt;We estimated that 1,166 law-enforcement-related deaths occurred in the US in 2015; The Counted captured a larger proportion of these deaths than the US mortality data.Law-enforcement-related deaths were most likely to be misclassified in mortality data if the death was not due to a gunshot wound or if it occurred in a low-income county.

&gt;**What do these findings mean?**

&gt;Datasets based on news media reports may offer higher-quality information on law-enforcement-related deaths than mortality data.Further exploration into the ways in which policymakers and public health officials report law-enforcement-related deaths is warranted."

"*Edit: I really appreciate everyone's comments and questions, but I'd like to encourage you to direct them to a qualified professional. Even with a degree under my belt, I'm just a guy, and I don't want anyone basing their decisions on anything I might seem to have suggested. If you decide one thing from all of this, it's that you should talk to a dietitian about whatever questions you have, and use them as your main resource for reliable nutrition information. It's what they're trained for, and believe me, they worked hard to get there.*

They keep hitting this ""alcohol is good/bad"" ball back and forth, it's gotta be confusing to a lot of people. I'm inclined to believe that people shouldn't be drinking with the aim of harnessing any potential health benefits, and instead should just understand that, for most people, the occasional drink isn't necessarily going to do them much *harm.* It seems like a lot of people use the ""daily drinking is healthy, right??"" excuse to indulge more than might be wise for them. Either way, it's too early for giving sweeping recommendations like that, in either direction.

Honestly, as an Applied Human Nutrition grad, this is one of the more frustrating things that both nutrition professionals and people in general have to deal with. There are just far too many generalized statements about things which, I think, don't take into account individual factors. When you're dealing with something as regular and lifelong as, well, *eating*, those differences can pile up over time, leading to vastly varied outcomes. This can lead to a lot of inconclusive science for nutrition professionals to try to sort through, and a lot of misunderstood information for everyone else. Just taking into account differences in activity level and lifestyle, saying that ""X is good, Y is bad,"" is often misleading. ""Good"" or ""bad"" *for whom* is often either not stated or conclusively definable in the research, not specified--or contexualized--in the reporting, or is totally misunderstood by the layman. As a result, we get people treating population-subset-specific findings as if they can be generalized across an entire population. It just leads to so much confusion and contradiction in the general discourse. This is why people need dietitians more than they appreciate, to navigate this labyrinth of information. (And I say this as someone who, degree notwithstanding, currently has no plans to become one.)

With all that going on, it's no wonder so many people can't take Nutrition seriously as a science."

In addition, the lack of protein and fiber in juice can predispose to inappropriate weight gain (too much or too little). Pediatricians need to be knowledgeable about juice to inform parents and patients on its appropriate uses.""

""data revealed that children 2 to 18 years of age consume nearly half of their fruit intake as juice, which lacks dietary fiber and predisposes to excessive caloric intake.""

&gt;2 Fruit juice offers no nutritional benefits over whole fruit for infants and children and has no essential role in healthy, balanced diets of children.

&gt;3 One hundred percent fresh or reconstituted fruit juice can be a healthy part of the diet of children older than 1 year when consumed as part of a well-balanced diet. Fruit drinks, however, are not nutritionally equivalent to fruit juice.

&gt;4 Juice is not appropriate in the treatment of dehydration or the management of diarrhea.

&gt;5 Excessive juice consumption may be associated with malnutrition (overnutrition and undernutrition).

&gt;6 Excessive juice consumption is associated with diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal distention, and tooth decay.

All my life, though, I've been coming back to Physics and Math, doing some sporadic reading, wishing I could pursue either field seriously, because it always felt like they were fundamental to everything we see around us, and the universe in general.

Glyphosate is the active component of Roundup (Montsanto, St Louis, MO, USA), the most widely used herbicide worldwide. It has been shown that the growth of Enterococcus faecalis bacteria isolated from cattle and horse faeces is inhibited by the lowest concentrations of glyphosate and the herbicide formulation tested.90 Further studies demonstrated that sensitivity to glyphosate is dependent on the bacterial strain. In particular, in poultry, pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella gallinarum, Salmonella typhimurium, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium botulinum are highly resistant to glyphosate, whereas beneficial bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus badius, Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Lactobacillus sp. are moderately to highly susceptible.91 If it were demonstrated that glyphosate induced similar dysbiosis in mammals, then this would be of toxicological relevance because it would lead to a reduction of potentially beneficial bacteria in the GI tract of the host.

Simultaneous entanglement swapping of multiple orbital angular momentum states of light. 

Nature Communications, 2017; 8 (1)

Abstract

&gt; High-bit-rate long-distance quantum communication is a proposed technology for future communication networks and relies on high-dimensional quantum entanglement as a core resource. While it is known that spatial modes of light provide an avenue for high-dimensional entanglement, the ability to transport such quantum states robustly over long distances remains challenging. To overcome this, entanglement swapping may be used to generate remote quantum correlations between particles that have not interacted; this is the core ingredient of a quantum repeater, akin to repeaters in optical fibre networks. Here we demonstrate entanglement swapping of multiple orbital angular momentum states of light. Our approach does not distinguish between different anti-symmetric states, and thus entanglement swapping occurs for several thousand pairs of spatial light modes simultaneously. This work represents the first step towards a quantum network for high-dimensional entangled states and provides a test bed for fundamental tests of quantum science.

"The full research article, *[TLR7 escapes X chromosome inactivation in immune cells
](http://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/3/19/eaap8855)* is published in Science Immunology.

**Summary**

Nine of 10 individuals who develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are women. Furthermore, individuals with Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) also have increased incidence of SLE, suggesting that X chromosome dosage could be an important risk factor in SLE. Using sensitive quantification methods, Souyris et al. demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) that is encoded from the X chromosome escapes X inactivation in B cells and myeloid cells in females and Klinefelter individuals. TLR7 binds single-stranded RNA and activates type I interferon signaling, a pathway that is also activated in SLE patients. On the basis of this, the authors propose that biallelic expression of TLR7 contributes to greater SLE risk in individuals with two X chromosomes.

**Abstract**

Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity, but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males. Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7 transcriptional expression than the monoallelic cells, correlated with higher TLR7 protein expression in female than in male leukocyte populations. Biallelic B cells were preferentially enriched during the TLR7-driven proliferation of CD27+ plasma cells. In addition, biallelic cells showed a greater than twofold increase over monoallelic cells in the propensity to immunoglobulin G class switch during the TLR7-driven, T cell-dependent differentiation of naive B lymphocytes into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. TLR7 escape from X inactivation endows the B cell compartment with added responsiveness to TLR7 ligands. This finding supports the hypothesis that enhanced TLR7 expression owing to biallelism contributes to the higher risk of developing SLE and other autoimmune disorders in women and in men with Klinefelter syndrome."

This uncertainty is related to several factors, including relatively large internal climate variability, model shortcomings, and because CA lies within a transition zone, where mid-latitude regions are expected to become wetter and subtropical regions drier. Here, we use a multitude of models to show CA may receive more precipitation in the future under a business-as-usual scenario. The boreal winter season-when most of the CA precipitation increase occurs-is associated with robust changes in the mean circulation reminiscent of an El Niño teleconnection. Using idealized simulations with two different models, we further show that warming of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures accounts for these changes. Models that better simulate the observed El Niño-CA precipitation teleconnection yield larger, and more consistent increases in CA precipitation through the twenty-first century.

From the paper:

&gt; In response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs), climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) versions 3 and 5 indicate decreases in precipitation in the subtropics and increases in middle to high latitudes. California lies near this transition zone, which contributes to the relatively large uncertainty in future projections of CA precipitation. Significant differences between CMIP3 and CMIP5 twenty-first century precipitation projections in central and southern California exist, with CMIP5 models tending to yield a more consistent increase. This was related to an eastward extension of the upper level winds in the east Pacific, which was suggested to shift the storm track towards the California coast, promoting an increase in precipitation.

The study compares suites of global climate models from 2007 (CMIP3) and 2014 (CMIP5). They attribute the increase in CA precipitation to a permanent-El-Niño-like trend in Pacific Ocean temperatures that changes the winter weather patterns in CA through teleconections (Rossby waves?)."
"This is fascinating work especially since I work with diasporas. I have two questions and I apologize that they are a bit wordy.

First, I'm curious about applying a similar kind of method to national borders. For example, if you expanded the boundaries of your map beyond the US to include Canada and Mexico, what would this look like? I recognize that incorporating illegal entry could make this work complicated (and politicized). But thinking about geography, citizenship, and belonging and the ways socio-cultural borders of belonging can be porous when political borders are not this kind of mapping is really interesting. Have you tried applying this to international borders? 

Second, I'd love to see utilization of this kind of mapping for ethnic borders and boundaries. Since ethnic groupings and borders do not depend upon political ones, it would be interesting to see how self identified ethnic communities are mapped onto contemporary American political boundaries and how they migrate/commute/return. But ideally this would be using data that is better than the Census, which is obviously limited and problematic for identifying ethnic communities especially sub-groups within larger categories. Are there datasets that would allow you to do that kind of mapping? "

Are children who are more developmentally delayed more likely to be spanked or scolded because they don't respond to other forms of discipline?

"To give some meat to what is mean by ""inoculate against misinformers' tricks"", the article defines the inoculation strategy as:

&gt; There are two elements to an inoculation: (1) an explicit warning of an impending threat and (2) a refutation of an anticipated argument that exposes the imminent fallacy. For example, an inoculation might include (1) a warning that there exist attempts to cast doubt on the scientific consensus regarding climate change, and (2) an explanation that one technique employed is the rhetorical use of a large group of ""fake experts"" to feign a lack of consensus. By exposing the fallacy, the misinformation (in this case, the feigned lack of consensus) is delivered in a ""weakened"" form. Thus, when people subsequently encounter a deceptive argument, the inoculation provides them with a counter-argument to immediately dismiss the misinformation.

Some examples of the inoculations used in their experiments:

&gt; The Scientific Consensus on Global Warming: Fossil fuel and political groups try to cast doubt on climate science, in order to delay regulation of the fossil fuel industry. They do this by manufacturing the appearance of an ongoing scientific debate.

&gt; The ""fake debate"" strategy was pioneered by the tobacco industry in the 1970s. They used doctors and scientists to reassure the public that smoking didn't cause health problems. These spokespeople were either non-experts or among the small minority of scientists who dissented from the scientific consensus that smoking is bad for you. However, in the public's eye, this conveyed the appearance of ongoing scientific debate.

&gt; The ""Tobacco Strategy"" is being used again, but this time to cast doubt on climate science. Less than 3% of climate scientists disagree with the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. However, when the media present the views of a dissenting scientist alongside a mainstream scientist, the public comes away with the mistaken impression of a 50:50 debate. Ironically, the journalistic standard of giving both sides equal weight has ended up distorting the state of climate science.

"I mean, fasting has been known to help the body heal for thousands of years.  For all of you people who hate ""cleanses"", that is what a fast is.  It allows your body to focus on improving/repairing/cleaning, instead of digesting/extracting nutrients.

I think most people would understand that these are incredibly hard question to answer and scientists might not like such inaccuracy, but this is such an urgent issue that ""something is better than nothing"" really seems key here.

"Flouride treatment also involves reduction.  It's acrive management of fluoride levels to keep them in the optimal range.  Too high or too low both cause problems.  Natural water sources runnthe gamut, and may need no adjustment, just monitoring.

Fluoridation of water or salt helps with marginal or poor hygeine.  Habits matter the most.  Fluoridation helps harden some of the surface layer of enamel, but that does not protect against candy before bed, lack of flossing, lack of brushing, and lack of tartar removal.  It's superseded by good cleaning with fluoridated toothpaste or mouthwash.

YMMV, but paying attn to results of hygeine at regular checkups, and taking action when results are inadequate, seems to be most important.

Abstract

Research on human navigation has indicated that males and females differ in self-reported navigation strategy as well as objective measures of navigation efficiency. In two experiments, we investigated sex differences in navigation strategy and efficiency using an objective measure of strategy, the dual-solution paradigm (DSP; Marchette, Bakker, &amp; Shelton, 2011). Although navigation by shortcuts and learned routes were the primary strategies used in both experiments, as in previous research on the DSP, individuals also utilized route reversals and sometimes found the goal location as a result of wandering. Importantly, sex differences were found in measures of both route selection and navigation efficiency. In particular, males were more likely to take shortcuts and reached their goal location faster than females, while females were more likely to follow learned routes and wander. Self-report measures of strategy were only weakly correlated with objective measures of strategy, casting doubt on their usefulness. This research indicates that the sex difference in navigation efficiency is large, and only partially related to an individual's navigation strategy as measured by the dual-solution paradigm.

I'm totally pro legalization and think it could seriously help a lot of people, and am under no illusions about how bad some react to SSRIs. But this is similar to the worry some people have about the ketamine trials to treat suicidal idealation and the chronically depressed: if cannabis helps to cause short term relief from symptoms without having a huge effect on the underlying neurochemistry, it seems like it would be quite dangerous for a patient reacting decently well to common antidepressants to decide ""hey might as well just stop taking these, here's the real answer"". The trials ive seen the tend to make it a battle of short term effective treatment/long term issues of dosing and not knowing what the underlying neurological effects are, versuscommon short term side effects/long term stability on a very specific regimen.

Highlights

. NSSI can have a wide range of underlying functions for the individual.

. This is the first meta-analysis of the prevalence of the functions of NSSI.

. Intrapersonal functions are more prevalent than interpersonal,

. Functions concerning an escape/avoidance of internal states are particularly common.

. Interpersonal functions are also endorsed by a substantial proportion of people.

Abstract

&gt; Background

&gt; A broad variety of different functions can underlie acts of Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Whilst research so far has identified many of the commonly reported functions, no reliable estimates of prevalence currently exist for these different NSSI functions. Understanding the prevalence of NSSI functions represents a key to better understanding the phenomenology of NSSI and addressing the differing needs of the NSSI population. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of NSSI functions in community and clinical samples.

&gt; Method

&gt; A literature search of electronic databases PsycINFO, Medline, and Web of Science from date of inception to March 2017 was undertaken. A pre-specified framework for categorising different functions of NSSI was used to collate data from across studies. A random-effects meta-analysis of prevalence was then undertaken on these data.

&gt; Results

&gt; Intrapersonal functions (66-81%), and especially those concerning emotion regulation were most commonly reported by individuals who engage in NSSI (63-78%). Interpersonal functions (e.g., expressing distress) were less common (33-56%).

&gt; Limitations

&gt; The review was limited to English-language articles. Reviewed articles were inconsistent in their measurement of NSSI. Inconsistency within pooled prevalence estimates was high when moderators were not accounted for.

&gt; Conclusions

&gt; Findings indicate that intrapersonal functions of NSSI are most common and are present for the majority of participants. This finding supports dominant emotion-regulation models of NSSI, and the use of interventions that work to improve emotion-regulation ability. However, interpersonal functions remain endorsed by a substantial portion of participants."

"Parents spend the first decade of their children's lives making choices for them and explaining why this or that choice is bad or inappropriate or unhealthy or too expensive or too difficult or whatever. They form a ""habit of judgement"".

Unfortunately by the time their teen starts making their ""Adult"" choices (what clothes will I wear, what do I like sexually, what career will I choose, how will I act, am I religious) parents have often changed from advisers to givers of law - and when a child's choice differs from theirs, it is no longer considered different, it is considered ""wrong"".

"Important to note that it will not eliminate disparities, it will simply bring them closer. This is an excellent proposal because it is exactly the opposite of things like Affirmative Action that reward people only on skin color. IQ testing for 1st graders would help select the best and brightest for gifted programs. These programs would not result in 1:1 participation based on population (which is what AA tries to achieve), and in some classes the effect would be the opposite of this study (and all minorities would be excluded). Such a result would be controversial, but ultimately very good.

"An analogy: Professional distance runners typically reach peak performance in their late 20's to early 30's, well after they reach peak VO2 Max, lactate threshold, and other gross physiological measures of fitness . In fact, by the time peak performance is reached, VO2 Max has typically declined by ~3-8% because of age. So, what's leading these runners to peak performance? RE, or running economy; essentially acquisition of an advanced motor skill. Why is this important, and what the hell does it have to do with cognitive training?  It's well established that running hills slightly improves RE in the near-term, as do intervals, as do fartleks, as does cross-country, as do slower long runs, as do plyometrics. Essentially anything running-related other than endlessly pounding ground at race-pace. Of course, each of these variations on training improve aspects *specific* to each specific variation most dramatically. Improvements to overall RE are much more subtle. But these subtle improvements are both cumulative and, I believe, compounding. Why? **Abstraction.**

With each new training variation there is an implicit and virtually unavoidable comparison. If a runner is used to running only flats, hills feel ""weird"". There are similarities and there are differences. The advantage of these comparisons are two-fold. First, they sensitize the runner to variations which relate to those specific circumstances; if running hills, a hill on a marathon course takes on new meaning, it becomes intimately familiar. Second, the differences across all these training variations amount to a distillation of that which is *essential* to all of them. Things like relaxed form, patterned breathing, minimal ground-contact time, minimizing vertical oscillation, even effort, economy of motion, are essentially constants across the board. When you have differences to compare, these similarities stand out.

Abstraction, perhaps the most important human intellectual tool, involves identifying constants and eliminating arbitrary details of elements which are both like and unalike. The greater the variety of challenging experiences, the more extensive the abstraction tool-case becomes. So, while we wouldn't expect any single training variation to carry significant ""far transfer"", taken together they should amount to an across-the-board increase in performance, inasmuch as similarities and common identifiable patterns exist within a broad array of cognitive challenges.

"There was an earlier study on this, I saw it on a different forum and asked my daughter (biologist) about it.  That study indicated that moderate exercise was protective, extreme exercise wasn't.

Here is our exchange:

OK I asked for a translation from my science-literate daughter (biologist), I asked:

Subject: translate, please 
From Science, not French.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2581416/

I believe this is saying that:
Moderate exercise is associated with delay in progression of cell dying in the cells with telomerase activity.
Inactivity or Too Much Exercise is associated with a quicker progression to cell death in the same cells
And
This effect is as big as the effect of psychological stress, infectious disease, or cardiovascular disease, in other words very significant.

Is this correct and are telomeres important to aging well? It makes logical sense to me from a civilian view - living well is protective, people with enough leisure time are healthier, moving around is better for you than being idle, but too much physical work will wear you out more than it helps you - but am not sure what the ""telomeres"" do, exactly, what effect does it have on people's lives and health? Or are they just a measure of time left, like a clock?


And she answers:

Okay, there's a lot going on here, so I'm going to break it down for you as well as I know how.

Telomeres are regions of repeated DNA at the end of chromosomes. They don't code for anything, but when DNA is copied (to make new cells) a little bit has to be left off at the end every time, so these large regions of extra DNA are there to protect the regions that do code for proteins and other important biological molecules. Telomerase is the enzyme that adds telomeres to the ends of your chromosomes, particularly during sex cell formation and fertilization. However, cell death is as important a process as cell division, and active telomerase is one of the things that's associated with cancerous growths, because the cells divide and divide out of control without ever reaching the end of their telomeres. So there's an inherent tradeoff between cell longevity and cancers balancing on telomerase activity.

This article is saying that moderate exercise is associated with longer telomeres, but also found that physical activity is not correlated with telomerase activity. They explain that, despite a 70 person sample size (which isn't that big in large-scale genomic research) their research is significant and in line with other groups' findings, but that because it's a correlational study, they can't really suggest a mechanism for why people with moderate exercise levels have longer telomeres than their idle or very active counterparts. That'll be the next step, I'm guessing.

It's important to keep in mind that telomeres are not the only reason people age. For example, the lamin proteins that hold DNA's shape in the nucleus also begin to break down. They're just one easily measurable marker of genetic aging that have made rounds in pop culture. From an evolutionary perspective, we age because it's a surer bet to keep our genes in the population through maximizing offspring rather investing in longevity lasting 'till the end of time, because accidental death is always a possibility.

Discounting Humanity: When Consumers are Price Conscious Employees Appear Less Human

Abstract

&gt; Consumers are frequently bombarded with a myriad of marketing tactics. One tactic regularly employed by thrift-oriented brands is to highlight low prices, discounts, and sales promotions. When consumers encounter these low-price signals, they may adopt a price conscious mentality, that is, a singular focus on getting the cheapest deal. A price conscious mentality is likely beneficial for consumers, as it helps them save money. However, it is also possible that it has negative implications, particularly for how consumers perceive and interact with other human beings in the marketplace, such as customer service employees. The current research addresses this issue by investigating how consumers' price conscious mentality impacts their perceptions of employees' humanity. Results from four studies demonstrate that a price conscious mentality can lead consumers away from fully recognizing the human qualities of employees. The findings also suggest that this subtle form of dehumanization can result in harsher treatment of employees when they provide less than satisfactory service.

"I already commented on the same thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/6emi3g/comment/dibiixs) in /r/psychology. 

I won't go into quite as much detail here as I did there, but based on some research I've done into the visual cortex as part of my AI research, I'd say that the reason behind this is that your brain prioritizes presenting visual information to your consciousness at as high a rate as possible at the expense of longer running input analysis in order to reduce the inherent latency in out visual system. Normally our visual processing is very synchronous across the visual cortex and this mechanism changes to a more asynchronous processing that ends up causing some information to be lost. This process would also explain people's tendency to not be able to remember an attackers face during a traumatic event but still be able to remember their words and voice as the audio cortex has no functional need need for such a mechanism.

It would make sense that responding faster to a threat is more advantageous than being able to properly analyze or remember facial information. 

Since anxiety also triggers many of the same mechanisms as the regular fight or flight response, it would make sense that it ends up trigging the same prioritization method.

Edit: [Here](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/26/15/3981) is a study about visual perception latency supporting the integral model of visual processing that I am describing."

Dentist-3: $350. I live in university town, so went to the dental school and saw a post grad dentist in fellowship training. She did teeth cleaning and replaced one filling at first visit. No need for more work.  Scheduled for f/u teeth cleaning every 6 to 12 month (my choice).

"I was once a disruptive boy in elementary school, and I am now a teacher.  I can tell you that we have a serious problem educating our boys.  While the business world has yet to catch up (glass ceilings and pay gap etc.), the education world is now dominated by women.  With perhaps the exception of math and science, women now graduate from high school and college (both undergraduate and graduate levels) at higher rates than men.

I am convinced that research like this is absolutely true and is one of the causes for the failure of our men/boys in education system.  Teachers perceive this behavior as bad and correct it.  However, these behaviors in boys, when properly channeled, become the good characteristics of men.  The rebel becomes the entrepreneur.  The disruptive boy becomes the critical thinker.  The boy that can't sit down for longer than 2 minutes becomes the hard worker.

I was lucky to have teachers that understood that boys being boys wasn't necessarily bad, and I was really lucky to have parents that worked with those teachers to channel with my behavior in a positive manner.  Most (drastically so) boys aren't as lucky as me."

"&gt;It has been suggested that intergroup conflict has played an important role in the evolution of human cooperation-aggression against out-groups and cooperation with in-groups may be linked in humans. Previous research suggests that religion may help to facilitate this effect, such that those who view religion as a way to achieve non-religious goals (e.g., raise their status) and regularly attend religious services are more likely to hold hostile attitudes towards out-groups, but that measures of religious devotion (e.g., belief in God) are either unrelated or negatively associated with measures of prejudice. Using questionnaires of key variables on a well-studied rural Jamaican population, we analyzed how different aspects of religious belief predict hostility towards other religions and loyalty to one's own. In support of previous research, our results indicate that hostility towards other religions is positively predicted by extrinsic religiosity (i.e., using religion to achieve non-religious goals: Allport 1954) and attendance at religious services but is negatively predicted by devotion to religious principles. Meanwhile, willingness to sacrifice for one's own beliefs is positively predicted by religious devotion. These results support the hypothesis that while devotion to religious principles can increase in-group cooperation, the social aspects of religion can generate hostile attitudes towards out-groups.

So, oversimplifying: sincere religious belief has positive outcomes all around, but externally facing shows of religiosity have negative outcomes associated with them.  "

"Hi Hector. 

What is your take of Fisher, Goddu &amp; Keil's (2015) recent research into technological  transactive memory partners? As a political scientist, I find the notion of an inflated sense of self knowledge to be an interesting one. Indeed, as the authors (2015, p. 2) suggest: 

*As people underestimate how much they are relying on the Internet, success at finding information on the internet may be conflated with personally mastered information, leading Internet users to erroneously include knowledge stored outside their own heads as their own. That is, when participants access outside knowledge sources, they may become systematically miscalibrated regarding the extent to which they rely on their transactive memory partner. It is not that they misattribute the source of their knowledge, they could know full well where it came from, but rather they may inflate the sense of how much of the sum total of knowledge is stored internally*

In my field, this would certainly prove an interesting avenue for further empirical research, or, in the least, the basis for a more in-depth theoretical exploration concerning the relationship between technology and citizen. To this end, do you feel that such arguments hold merit?"

"As someone who flits in and out of depressive periods (not quite SADS, but it tends to go for a couple months at a time) I can say that the right approach seems to be to realize ""I feel like shit."", sit there and do absolutely nothing including not looking at a screen for about an hour, and then get up and start something like laundry.  And then when you're done with that, go for a walk.  Usually after the walk I don't feel like shit anymore and can progress with my day.  I do that a few times over a couple weeks and I usually start feeling better overall."

Something tells me we (humans) didn't evolve by sleeping so deeply recessed in remove caves that there were no visible stars and moon, so I can't see a mechanism by which light-at-night is universally bad for our physiology. Perhaps some other aspect of our physiology is necessitating the no-LAN issue. Also, this was performed in an elderly population, who probably have completely different needs when it comes to maintaining circadian rhythms.

"I haven't seen any of these studies discuss the cultural differences between countries. For example, in Belgium Physics is viewed as typically very male for whatever reason. There are very few of us girls studying it over here. But when a commission came through to evaluate all physics degrees there was an Italian woman among them. And she kept asking why there are so few women. Including in a delegation of students, who really have no clue or impact on that. Point being that according to her there is gender parity in physics in Italy. Discussing this later it was mentioned by someone that Physics isn't regarded as  such a hard field as it is over here. And that the perception is very different.

Now I can't corroborate that information, which is why I'm interested in studies that include the broader societal/cultural context. I think it's an interesting and potentially relevant factor.

"This is obviously cool. A number of companies and research groups have had clinical success with taking a patient's immune cells and genetically modifying them so that they can hunt down and destroy the tumor cells within the patient's body.

A concern that is sometimes voiced, however, is that the process of harvesting and then genetically modifying the cells on a one by one basis is time consuming (about 10 days in the hands of experts) and expensive. So some people have asked, wouldn't it be great if there was an ""off the shelf"" T-celll line that could be used, thereby avoiding the need to engineer new cells for each patient. That is what was tried here.

It seems like it may have worked, but there are some caveats:

- the patients received pretty heavy chemo and targeted therapy in addition to the T-cell therapy, so it isn't easy to say what actually drove the response.

- this treatment wasn't by itself designed to be curative. Rather, it was intended to bridge the patients to another treatment that would be curative - a stem cell transplant.

- while the response rate (2/2) is impressive, this is obviously a very small set of patients. The important number to look out for will be duration of remission. We're these patients cured? Or will the disease relapse in a few months? We don't know yet, but previous studies suggest that the risk of relapse is still very real.

- to what extent is the allogenic origin of the T-cells a problem? Will we see graft versus host disease? Host versus graft?"

"My vitamin basically dropped to zero.  Had all kinds of issues that centered around the small intestine.  It eventually spiked in severity with me sleeping all the time, barely wanted to get out of bed.  Pepto bismol liquid seemed to be the only thing that helped, but I was trying random antacids and anything else too.

Doctor had me take 40m of pepcid and stop with pepto.  Also take 50000IU of vitamin D a week.  Symptoms subsided.  I still used pepto if diarrhea got too bad.  It was livable. I did have a colonoscopy that found nothing.

Doctor really had no answers, said it could be IBS.

Searching for symptoms such as gurgling and spasms in the small intestine, I found someone describing a similar problem who ended up having microscopic colitis and it cleared up with pepto bismol. Even found this paper:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9428215

So I started taking pepto bismol pills.  Took on average 2 every four hours.  Did that for 3 months and the intestinal issues are pretty much cleared up.  I can have some symptoms return if stomach is really empty, then I pop pepto and drink water.(maybe once every two weeks)  I am still taking the pepcid.  If I do stop taking the pepcid, issues do start to come back.

I feel even if the pepto didn't cure anything, it at least helped things heal that weren't healing.  Once healed up the pepto seems to be enough.

"I discovered that I had a vitamin D deficiency (10ng) and started supplementing D3. It has resolved a lot of my insomnia issues, sleep deprivation and general fogginess. There are easy tests you can get from your doctor, but in the US and Europe, it's very common to have to request these tests as they aren't always scheduled unless you're elderly.

[Blood serum D3](https://www.vitamindcouncil.org/i-tested-my-vitamin-d-level-what-do-my-results-mean/) lab results are given in 10 ng/mL factors typically. Levels are usually grouped as follows:

* 0-10ng: highly deficient and at risk for bone weakening; can't efficiently absorb bioavailable calcium. Osteoporosis, bone fracture risk in the long-term.

* 10-20ng: deficient and at risk for the same factors as above.

* 20-30ng: low but normal

* 30-40ng: normal

* 40-50ng: normal

* 60-70ng: high but normal, shouldn't supplement

* 70ng+: high, don't supplement

* 150+: toxicity may occur, vomiting, nausea, constipation.

One common misconception is that people who live in sunny areas don't have vitamin D deficiency.

"There aren't equal numbers of men and women in biology classrooms, so the average man seeing themselves as smarter than 60% of the class is not as fallacious as it might seem. I don't know if the reporter grasps this point, because they wrote

&gt; 
Statistically, about half of people in any group should be above the average, and half below it.

As though it alone were sufficient to show men were overconfident. And you need a comparison to their actual class ranking in order to establish that, which I assume the study did but the article failed to report on.

Edit: read the study. The reporter seems to have turned:

&gt; Using the best model and controlling for all other variables, the average man with a 3.3 GPA (average GPA of students in the class) is predicted to perceive that he is smarter than 66% of students in the physiology class, whereas the average woman with a 3.3 GPA is predicted to perceive that she is smarter than only 54% of the students in the physiology class (Fig. 1A).

into

&gt; The average grade in the class was a 3.3. But when they asked students to ask if they were smarter than their classmates, ""the average male student thinks he is smarter than 66 percent of the class, while the average female student thinks she is smarter than 54 percent of the class,"" Brownell said.

&gt; Statistically, about half of people in any group should be above the average, and half below it.

So the study itself is fine, and the reporting is too, interpreted correctly. It's a matter of reading ""average male student"" as indicating ""male who scores the same as the class average"" rather than as ""male who scores the same as the average male score"".

I wonder what would happen if they compared to test scores rather than GPA. Could be that students think tests measure intelligence and discount the value of homework, and that this is partially responsible for the gap in self-reported intelligence as compared to GPA. Men's advantage on testing and women's on homework are well known."

Probably this is a real effect, but with a sample size of nearly 300 people these data suggest the effect is very small.

On the other hand, the view of Parental Competence is much more strongly (and significantly) affected.

EDIT: It's worth pointing out, as some have below, that statistical significance and effect size are not strictly related concepts. Low statistical significance does not necessarily indicate a small effect size, although a small effect size can result in low statistical significance (one only needs to inspect the equation for [selecting sample size](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2876926/) to observe this.)

"How much impact does personal change of lifestyle have? I would think a lot since without consumers large industries and corporations have no reason to do anything.

Over the months I have read scientific research and compiled as short as possible list of personal changes every person can make. Can you please look at it and see if I'm mistaken about something.


FOOD:

* **eat less meat, dairy, and other animal products (none is the best)**
* eat less industrially produced food, less processed food, less packaged foods (for example, bottled water uses energy to be packaged and refrigerated, and produces plastic waste so drink tap water)
* eat proper portion sizes
* remember that food which pets consume also has impact on the environment so adopt don't shop to discourage their production, and choose pets that are herbivores

ENERGY:

* **drive less, cycle and walk as much as possible, avoid flying**
* use efficient lightbulbs, turn the lights off when you're not in the room
* Unplug devices when not in use (to simplify this you can get remote controlled electrical outlet, some are very cheap)
* insulate your home, don't warm or cool the rooms more than necessary
* criticize and complain about large buildings like malls that warm up or cool down the air too much
* forgo living in a single-family house in favor of apartment-style housing. (that way more people get to live on less land, sharing walls is more energy efficient, commutes are shorter etc.)
* buy solar panels
* don't be afraid of nuclear power plants

WASTE

* avoid items with too much packaging
* don't buy more than you need (but for items that you are certain you will use and can last for a while buy in bulk to avoid extra packaging)
* buy recyclable items (q-tips with paper stick instead of plastic, bamboo toothbrushes, etc.)
* recycle
* avoid single-use items (don't use disposable cutlery and cups e.g. bring reusable tumbler to Starbucks, disposable wipes, disposable plastic bags, if you are menstruating use menstrual cups instead of pads or tampons, etc.)
* contact manufacturers and complain of excess packaging

WATER:

* don't flush the toilet when not necessary
* don't throw anything in the toilet except bodily fluids and solids, and toilet paper (no cotton pads, no q-tips, no floss, no tampons, no cigarette butts, no paper towels...)
* turn the water off while you are lathering, brushing your teeth etc.
* cut down on showers and baths
* don't water your lawns, try to plant local plants that don't need watering 

ACTIVISM:

* Encourage others to adopt sustainable lifestyle (feel free to share this list)
* Donate money to environmental charities
* Be careful who you vote for, pressure your representatives and politicians
* Look into buying carbon emission offset (this is the only point on this list that I haven't researched yet, so I'm not sure)

"My understanding is (and please correct me if I'm wrong), transitioning is the most effective way of treating gender disphoria. This is in effect trying to change the physical body to agree with how the mind perceives it's gender.

Has there been research into the inverse of that, that is changing the mind to be okay with, and identify with, the biological sex of the individual?

For example if there was a drug one could take to make one identify as their biological gender, this seems far less traumatic than surgery to superficially alter the body to make it appear different. 

A question I'd have following that though is can a cis person take that same medication to artificially identify as the opposite biological sex?

Are Liberals and Conservatives Equally Motivated to Feel Empathy Toward Others?

Abstract

Do liberals and conservatives differ in their empathy toward others? This question has been difficult to resolve due to methodological constraints and common use of ideologically biased targets. To more adequately address this question, we examined how much empathy liberals and conservatives want to feel, how much empathy they actually feel, and how willing they are to help others. We used targets that are equivalent in the degree to which liberals and conservatives identify with, by setting either liberals, conservatives, or ideologically neutral members as social targets. To support the generalizability of our findings, we conducted the study in the United States, Israel, and Germany. We found that, on average and across samples, liberals wanted to feel more empathy and experienced more empathy than conservatives did. Liberals were also more willing to help others than conservatives were, in the United States and Germany, but not in Israel. In addition, across samples, both liberals and conservatives wanted to feel less empathy toward outgroup members than toward ingroup members or members of a nonpolitical group."

"While I agree that sugar consumption is a huge health problem, I'm not sure I agree with the government imposing sin taxes to dissuade consumption.


Edit: to everyone commenting about Pigovian taxes, medical costs, etc passed on to the public I would like to remind them that sugar(HFCS) is extremely inexpensive due to government subsidies on corn.  A tax on sugar would be a tax on an item we give the producers a tax break on. 

Corn is cheap and plentiful due to subsidies found in the farm bill, excess corn is turned into HFCS, which makes it into cheap highly palpable foods. 

Additionally, the US government spent the last 50 years telling people to not eat fat or salt. Food tastes terrible without salt, fat, or sugar. So cheap HFCS is added. 


Maybe we'd all be better off if the government just stayed out of the way.

"Right off the bat I do feel like their is going to be blockers in these discussions. But I have a question related to sports, specifically weightlifting. Recently a transgender women won a [national weightlifting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/03/22/transgender-woman-wins-international-weightlifting-title-amid-controversy-over-fairness/?utm_term=.75a46f85b11a) competition. I strongly believe that it is not fair to the born female competitors to let a trans women compete. My largest supporting argument is that steroids are banned in this particular weightlifting federation. The trans women in a physical standpoint only, can be compared to a born female competitor who has been taking steroids most their life. Men produce significantly more testosterone than women, and the hormone is directly linked to muscle size growth and strength. There is a reason test is the number one most used PED. The latter would be banned for life, while the former was allowed to compete and she blew the rest of the competition out of the water. Coupled with the fact that men have superior muscle insertions and bone structure to facilitate heavy lighting and greater strength potential, I see this as extremely unfair. I am NOT saying Laurel Hubbard became trans just to dominate weightlifting, I believe she truly wanted to be a female. However, I think that making that choice to switch from male to female should eliminate the ability to compete in competitive sport environments, as it gives a largely unfair disadvantage to the majority of the competitors. In my own opinion, I believe the only reason she was allowed to compete is due to people's fear of being labeled bigoted, as it is quite known there is a lot of negative feelings in the general weightlifting community when it comes to her being allowed to compete."

"I don't think people realize how their actions can affect their children. Many parents will stay together for the kids and hate each other not understanding their choice will inadvertently cause damage to their child. Example, children see the lack of affection and love and grow up with no empathy or regard to others. Children grow up seeing their parents fighting and abuse each other and then they grow up repeating the same events sometimes just as so or maybe less. I've heard some parents will even pull their child into their disagreements making them choose a side or worse use religion as a point to say they must stay together. It's a tragic circumstance that is all too often.  One mother told her son that no matter how much he and his ex wife hated each other they must remain married for their child. They divorced anyway and their son exhibits behavior of the home he grew up in. Its unfair to remain in any situation that is abusive or not happy to the child and the people involved. "

Abstract

&gt; Although several types of architecture combining memory cells and transistors have been used to demonstrate artificial synaptic arrays, they usually present limited scalability and high power consumption. Transistor-free analog switching devices may overcome these limitations, yet the typical switching process they rely on-formation of filaments in an amorphous medium-is not easily controlled and hence hampers the spatial and temporal reproducibility of the performance. Here, we demonstrate analog resistive switching devices that possess desired characteristics for neuromorphic computing networks with minimal performance variations using a single-crystalline SiGe layer epitaxially grown on Si as a switching medium. Such epitaxial random access memories utilize threading dislocations in SiGe to confine metal filaments in a defined, one-dimensional channel. This confinement results in drastically enhanced switching uniformity and long retention/high endurance with a high analog on/off ratio. Simulations using the MNIST handwritten recognition data set prove that epitaxial random access memories can operate with an online learning accuracy of 95.1%."

"From my friend studying AI: ""The problem isn't humans making assumptions, the problem is that our cognition is based on *entirely* on assumptions. And because the vast majority of our assumptions are correct, it's very difficult to change them, like climbing out of a steep ravine. People with high intelligence may not be able to overcome prejudice either. Only people with high adaptability in their mental habits can change easily. Everyone else is just taught from an early age. There is a correlation between valuing education and valuing humans. But one does not case the other."""

&gt;More broadly, men and women differ sharply in their attitudes toward the relative importance of online harassment as an issue. For instance, women (63%) are much more likely than men (43%) to say people should be able to feel welcome and safe in online spaces, while men are much more likely than women to say that people should be able to speak their minds freely online (56% of men vs. 36% of women). Similarly, half of women say offensive content online is too often excused as not being a big deal, whereas 64% of men - and 73% of young men ages 18 to 29 - say that many people take offensive content online too seriously. Further, 70% of women - and 83% of young women ages 18 to 29 - view online harassment as a major problem, while 54% of men and 55% of young men share this concern.

"I've thought about this a lot, and I think that the only way to make a big change across an entire country or globally is some kind of carbon tax. It could be as simple as taxing any man made product that releases carbon, then taking all that money and giving it back as a tax refund. That way people who cause a lot of greenhouse gas emissions can subsidize the people who buy solar panels and electric cars.

On a personal level, the most important thing I think anyone can do is to eat less meat. That's a very controversial idea right now, but after going over all the data, it seems like the biggest personal choice a person can make. It doesn't mean go vegan, just something as small as reducing meat consumption by 1% per year could make an important difference if enough people did it. Here's the key ideas:

* Renewables aren't a solution anymore, we need to keep switching to renewables to keep the damage from getting completely out of hand, but renewables won't reverse global warming. We've built a greenhouse out of carbon around the planet and everyday it gets a tiny bit warmer. Even if we stop all greenhouse gas emissions today, it's still going to get warmer everyday for the rest of our lives, we've already done too much damage.
* So, we have to take carbon out of the atmosphere too. What's the best way to do that? Well, people have been trying to think of new technologies to do it for the last 30 or 40 years, and we still don't have any ideas that are ready to go. Maybe in the next 30 or 40 years we'll think of one? But if it's not good enough, or if it takes too long, it could be too late. We should start today doing what we know how to do.
* The only carbon sequestration ""technology"" we know of today that works and can be scaled large enough to have an impact is planing forests.
* Unfortunately instead of planting more forests, we're still cutting down huge amounts of forest every year.
* From 2000 to 2013 we [cut down 7% of the world's forests](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/1/e1600821.full)
* [Carbon in all the world's forests is about 638 GtC](http://www.unece.org/forests/outlook/carbonsinks.html)
* All manmade [carbon emissions add up to about 10 GtC per year](http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/16/highlights.htm)
* If instead of spending time and energy to cut down forests, we'd been re-planting forests and had added 7% more  over the last 13 years we would've sequestered the equivalent of 50% of human GHG emissions.
* Forests can sequester enough carbon to make us carbon neutral if we increase their area by about 1% per year. It'll take a long time, but they'll catch up eventually. And forests aren't like trees, when a tree falls down, the carbon ends up back in the air. When a tree in a forest falls down a large percentage of that carbon ends up in the ground through natural processes. In fact, the soil in a forest holds more carbon than the trees.
* And planting forests on this scale is surprisingly doable, if it's something entire countries are making a priority.
* [Indian volunteers planted *50 million* trees in a *single day*](if instead of spending time and energy to cut down forests, we'd been re-planting forests and had added 7% more  over the last 13 years we would've sequestered the equivalent of 50% of human GHG emissions.)
* And we're learning to [automate the process of planting new forests](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2015/03/21/what-does-it-take-to-grow-a-forest) and learning how to [plant fast growing, high density forests](http://blog.ted.com/shubhendusharma/)
* The only real obstacle is space, right now the land area of earth is split in to three very roughly thirds: 1/3 forest, 1/3 used for animal agriculture and 1/3 everything else (cities, deserts, etc.). This might seem ridiculous that we use up that much space on livestock, but consider that right now livestock outweighs humans by 2-to-1. Cattle are by weight, the single most populous species on the planet. And all those animals need to eat, a lot. All that food needs land, we use *much* more space growing food to feed to animals then we do for direct human consumption. A cattle needs around 10 pounds of food to make one pound of meat. 
* But that also means there's a huge amount of room for improvement. No one has to become vegan, no one even has to give up 50% of the meat they eat. If we just reduce consumption a little bit every year, and use the land that frees up to grow forests, we could literally solve global warming in our lifetimes. And it's something that anyone can start doing today."

"Also, alot of psychedelics have this nature of changing one's outlook on life. Some people call LSD and shrooms life changing, and strongly assert that people should take it at least once in their life time. Mdma was proposed for clinical settings when it first came out because of the introspective nature it brought out in people, allowing them to better reflect than normal.

I think that like most other psychedelics, ayahuasca can cause things to go bad mentally real fast if the person isnt really prepared, and this would only be compounded by the throwing up

""What is added by this report?
During 1999-2015, suicide rates increased across all levels of urbanization, with the gap in rates between less urban and more urban areas widening over time, most conspicuously over the later part of this period. Geographic disparities in suicide rates might reflect suicide risk factors known to be prevalent in less urban areas, such as limited access to mental health care, social isolation, and the opioid overdose epidemic, because opioid misuse is associated with increased risk for suicide. That the gap in rates began to widen more noticeably after 2007-2008 might reflect the influence of the economic recession, which disproportionately affected less urban areas.""

First they blame drugs. Then isolation and distance to medical help. Finally say maybe it's economic perhaps because of the economic downturn of 2008. Drug problems flourish where economic prospects dwindle. 2000 also marked another economic downturn that was mainly alleviated by the housing bubble leading up to the bust in 2008. I don't think rural America saw many gains from the housing bubble. So we have an area hard hit by economic malaise where opportunities are scarce and drug addiction has filled the gap. An area neglected for decades by government and never discussed by media. It's economic first. And the government needs to get off its ass and do much much more to help rural America. "

"Hi Professor!

So, it is an interesting stigma because one of the things we are told as graduates or incoming graduates is that we need to be the absolute best candidate we can be which requires us to 1) take on more degrees and courseloads and/or 2) become interdisciplinary in our work and training to the point we lose focus.  

At the end of the day, at the end of the day, I am given the impression that graduate students are forced to ""overcompete"" with each other which leads losers to be overqualified because they are forced to find jobs related to their dream positions but don't necessarily require all that expertise.  Attach the stigma that those who take those jobs will quickly leave as soon as a better opportunity opens up, and you have a recipe for a lost-lost cause for many outgoing graduates nowadays.
 
Mentors are doing their best to train upcoming apprentice and junior scientists into being as competitive as possible for future positions.  But I remember my boss saying to me that P.I.s need to start taking birth control.  That they're training and overtraining students for jobs that just aren't there.  I get the idea that science should be choosing the best and the brightest, but that doesn't fix the main problem: 1 dozen best and bright candidates, 1 position.

What do you think about this birth control idea?  Given that many tenureship applications and other university obligations force the academic pipeline to remain flowing, would you think that this could be a reasonable fix if universities were to shift paradigms and essentially implement more rigid quotas on incoming graduates?  I think this might shock many labs who rely on student research, but if it will essentially improve employment prospects for newly-qualified researchers, would this be a reasonable solution?"
So is this a mental catch 22?

Anoxia occurs when deep waters get turned over, or when debris on the sea bed, such methane hydrates, are belched up. Just such as gigantic belch is thought to be the or a cause of the Permian - Triassic extinction. Perhaps a sea strike by a meteorite leading to methane hydrate releases?

"I was reading an article recently about male birth control. It cited one of the side effects being increased depression and one suicide during the course of the study. This brought serious concerns about the safety of the drug. The article continued on to compare the rate for men to the rate of depression in women's birth control. I want to say it was something like 10% v 30% respectively. I was surprised as that's not something that is commonly discussed as a side effect in women's BC, yet the numbers suggested that it was common. My point in sharing this is that women (including teenage girls) have had better access to health care and BC in the same time period. I wonder if the correlation is there instead. But then there's always the ice cream sales and murders to consider.

"Really weird seeing a David Dunson paper pop up like this. This paper is a statistical methodology paper, published in a statistics journal. The paper, I expect, says very little stuff about the science aside from background, and focuses on their model building. Just so everyone knows, it was peer reviewed by statisticians who are mostly clueless about the science here (but obviously very knowledgeable about statistics)! So IMO the science aspect should be taken with a huge grain of salt.

Dunson's group does do a lot of collaboration with neuroscientists. I would wait for this work to pop up in a neuroscience journal before taking the conclusions drawn seriously. The methodology is serious though. Dunson is at the top of his field, and the student he is working with here has seemed pretty good to me (I'm a statistics professor FWIW, sorry about no flair)."

"Everything in moderation.

The problem is, most parents are not teaching their children moderation with social media.

I am so glad my school does not allow phones in the classroom. Coincidentally (maybe), we also have the highest test scores in the district.

However, I see a lot of my students after school, and they have to snap chat every single moment of their life.

It's not just teens guilty of this. Look at the adults around us. Do people ever log out of facebook? I make rules for myself. If I'm with family, for example, my phone goes in my purse on silent until I leave. Now, it doesn't really matter because my sister is in the corner taking 30 selfies.

The problem is when you try to balance your life, it's hard because the people surrounding you do not seem to have it balanced. I am still trying to find this balance.

It's weird, growing up, it seems we has a class for everything about our health. Now I know barely anything that reaches out to students about the pressures of social media. 

I don't ever purposefully look at my students' profiles, but once in a while I find them. I will see that their pictures get hundreds of likes, yet it will be so strange because I never see them talk or have friends in school. I'm not judging, but it is weird that I guess our society now values that superficial ""like"" system over real life relationships.

As for me, I seem to be in limbo. I have really felt the value of my relationships go down the past 5 years or so, and while that can be attributed to many things, I partly blame social media. It's so much easier to be flaky now. It's so much easier to feel that liking someone's photo is the same as having a real conversation with them.

It honestly started to make me feel really depressed. Now, I severely limit my use of social media. I go on Facebook once a day, and that's it. I log out. I only post once in a while. I really like photography, so I use snap chat to share some of the beautiful places I visit. Instagram is kind of an afterthought to me, but once in a while I post a photo. The point is, it took me a while to not feel I have to update every aspect of my life, every time I look good, every time I hang out with a friend.

And I do get it. I think we are all trying to ""hold on"" to these moments because they are so fleeting. Do I blame the parent posting 3000 photos of their kid? No. But I often wonder if we have forgotten that our memories still exist.

Going back to earlier, it's not even enjoyable spending time with my sisters anymore. It's really a battle of how many likes they can get for photos and their status updates about where we eat and all that. Sometimes I wish it was like when we were younger and we could just hang out.

Don't tell me I'm alone. I know I'm not. And again, everything in moderation. But our society seems to have a problem with that concept.

Finally, it is affecting our children. They do need to be constantly entertained. I am teaching my students the value of boredom, and crazy as that may sound to some. We take a few moments each day to just be bored."
"Adrian Raine, the study author, concludes, 

&gt; ""Is it the case that low social class and early social adversity results in daytime drowsiness, which results in inattention or brain dysfunction, which results 14 years later in crime? The answer's yes,"" he said. ""Think of a flow diagram from A to B to C to D. Think of a chain. There is a significant link.""

I find it kind of baffling that this is his conclusion. Note that he didn't *control* for socioeconomic status; he simply tacks it onto the front of his causal chain. A much simpler explanation is that low socioeconomic status is associated with an unstable home life and a poor sleep schedule is part of the package. Child poverty is also associated with later criminality, but who knows to what degree it is due to poor sleep compared to the multitude of other consequences of poverty?"
"I have no opinions about vaping, but I do have some questions in regard to the study: For starters, why are they measuring the lead concentration using ug/kg (mass/mass) to quantify vapor exposure - that's not how inhalation hazards are measured.  Vapor exposure is measured in mass/volume, (typically ug/L) - which would be the necessary unit of measure here since you're trying to quantify the amount of lead that is potentially being inhaled.  Secondly, why aren't they (at a minimum) providing the PELs for these metals?  They say ""potentially unsafe levels"" but not once do they say what the NIOSH/OSHA/EPA/Etc screening/permissable levels are.  If your goal is to highlight that you identified unsafe levels, there's no reason not to provide the baselines for your comparison, which I would assume is the workplace or residential screening levels.  

There may be good or even valid reasons for using a mass/mass reporting limit, but I personally don't see why you would use one in this instance.  I also want to be clear - lead vapor inhalation is one of the most dangerous ways to be exposed to lead - so it seems like if you were going to write a study on people being exposed to it, you'd at least do it correctly.  It seems like pretty lazy/bad science and more than a little click-baity.  "

"I'm a recovering opiate addict and I keep seeing these articles about Marijuana's potential to mitigate the opioid epidemic and I've gotta say that while for some it might be effective, for many others it can be detrimental. When I finally really started trying to clean up my act, I kept this attitude that at least I could still smoke weed, and it was that attitude that led me and many others to relapse time and time again. For me, smoking Marijuana paled in comparison to opiates so much that I found it to be wholly unsatisfying, and it would trigger intense cravings for the good stuff, to which I eventually caved. 

I now recognize that I simply can't handle mind altering substances, period. People need to understand that opiates are on a completely different level and that once you're addicted, it never leaves you. It gets easier over time, yes, but you never forget. I still get cravings from time to time, but I just deal with them in stride. 

I don't think Marijuana is the answer here, but to each their own I guess. Personally, I think it's detrimental to recovery. Surely no one believes that people can trade in their heroin addiction for smoking some pot occasionally? "
"The study doesn't really clarify whether male students are in fact more disruptive than female students with similar playfulness scores. It's possible that playfulness manifests itself in males in such a manner that leads to more class interruptions for instance, whereas in females it presents differently.

"&gt;Although the cancer death rate remained 15% higher in blacks than in whites in 2014, increasing access to care as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may contribute to a further narrowing of the racial gap across all population groups.

"Intrasexual competition is stronger than intersexual competition. This is something evolutionary psychologists have discovered a long time ago. As we compete for mates it would not make sense for a man to primary compete vs. women. The same way it would not make sense for a woman to compete against men. In actuality a man would gain more by making sure he was the most succesful man in the group. While making all the women unsuccessful would not make his mating options more numerous. And at worst it would make him look like a bad potential mate. And if he actually was supportive of women it would have a positive effect on his mating options.

&gt; Infant and childhood food allergy, whose cause has long been a mystery, has now been linked to a mix of environmental and genetic factors that must coexist to trigger the allergy, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study.


&gt; The factors contributing to food allergy include the genetics that alter skin absorbency, use of infant cleansing wipes that leave soap on the skin, skin exposure to allergens in dust and skin exposure to food from those providing infant care. Food allergy is triggered when these factors occur together.

Mechanism for initiation of food allergy: Dependence on skin barrier mutations and environmental allergen costimulation.

Abstract:

&gt; Background

&gt; Mechanisms for the development of food allergy in neonates are unknown but clearly linked in patient populations to a genetic predisposition to skin barrier defects. Whether skin barrier defects contribute functionally to development of food allergy is unknown.

&gt; Objective

&gt; The purpose of the study was to determine whether skin barrier mutations, which are primarily heterozygous in patient populations, contribute to the development of food allergy.

&gt; Methods

&gt; Mice heterozygous for the filaggrin (Flg)ft and Tmem79ma mutations were skin sensitized with environmental and food allergens. After sensitization, mice received oral challenge with food allergen, and then inflammation, inflammatory mediators, and anaphylaxis were measured.

&gt; Results

&gt; We define development of inflammation, inflammatory mediators, and food allergen-induced anaphylaxis in neonatal mice with skin barrier mutations after brief concurrent cutaneous exposure to food and environmental allergens. Moreover, neonates of allergic mothers have increased responses to suboptimal sensitization with food allergens. Importantly, responses to food allergens by these neonatal mice were dependent on genetic defects in skin barrier function and on exposure to environmental allergens. ST2 blockade during skin sensitization inhibited the development of anaphylaxis, antigen-specific IgE, and inflammatory mediators. Neonatal anaphylactic responses and antigen-specific IgE were also inhibited by oral pre-exposure to food allergen, but interestingly, this was blunted by concurrent pre-exposure of the skin to environmental allergen.

&gt; Conclusion

&gt; These studies uncover mechanisms for food allergy sensitization and anaphylaxis in neonatal mice that are consistent with features of human early-life exposures and genetics in patients with clinical food allergy and demonstrate that changes in barrier function drive development of anaphylaxis to food allergen."

"I did a little bit of research about this a few years ago in college. This works fairly well as a partial treatment, especially for mild incidences, however it is not a complete treatment, particularly for chronic or severe episodes. If someone is depressed or has anxiety, they should supplement exercise with therapy and possibly medication. Also consider that recent developments have given popularity to a concept of depression as a cluster of symptoms, with specific types of depression associated with different expressions of those clusters.

There are two major aspects to mood and emotion, Negative Affect (NA) and Positive Affect (PA). Positive Affect is a fairly easy gauge, it essentially refers projection of mood out into the world: Energy, enthusiasm, confidence, sadness. Negative Affect is harder to gauge immediately, it is an internal perception of the world and one's self, encompassing things like nervousness, anxiety, fear, self-image, guilt, and trust. The big thing to understand is that PA and NA are mostly independent of one another. You can have a high PA (energetic, happy, confident) and still have low NA (anxious, untrusting, poor self-image), or have high NA (calm, trusting, and good self-image) and PA. Exercise increases PA, but does not impact NA at all, in the 20+ papers I referenced not a single one could show any change to NA that correlated to exercise. Compared to average measures for people unaffected, mild cases of anxiety and depression exhibit a drop of PA about 2/3 of severe cases, and NA drops by about half of what it would for severe cases.

What exercise does is create a temporary (2-4 hours) boost to PA, vigorous exercise exaggerates the effect some, but the time frame remains fairly stable. For people with depression or anxiety, this effect is generally about one-quarter of what a person without a mood disorder would experience. For someone with severe depression or anxiety, the effect is reduced by an order of magnitude or more. What ends up happening is over larger time frames (6+ months) regular exercise creates upward trends in PA for everyone. It is small, but the increases are greater the lower your baseline PA, so those with the most severe depression will probably see the biggest immediate benefit. On top of that, it appears to work on a diminishing return principle, but that point appears to be the roughly the same across the board, so a normal person will reach that point much faster than someone with a mood disorder.

As I said, though, NA is entirely unaffected, though most people experience isolated episodes of anxiety and depression so it is possible that NA levels will return to level on their own as they recover. Alternatively, it is possible for external changes in one's body and mood can reflect and increase NA, but several of the studies I read covered people over a decade with no noticeable correlation. NA is something that can be, in many cases, improved with therapy, particularly CBT that will help train methods of thought redirection and awareness. In some cases, medication will be required, most often with severe or chronic sufferers. I ran a case study which replicated these results as well.

TL;DR: Exercise provides big boosts to enthusiasm, energy, and happiness for a short time and slowly improves it over months when engaged in consistently, but does not improve self-perception, trust or anxiousness. Treatment for depression and anxiety is two-factor, exercise is only one part, therapy and possibly medication is the other part.

"Neat, but kind of flawed study. While the stress reduction and social networks that come with church probably do help reduce mortality risk for a few select causes, the study fails to take into account what kind of people actually go to church. It is likely that people with better health, better living conditions and more money are able to attend church frequently, and therefore it would be reasonable to expect a correlation between the health and churchgoing (but not a causation). It would be great to follow this study up with research on different institutions, both secular and religious, and classify these institutions by potential factors such as community involvement, health, living conditions, and income of attendees."

For most people, there is simply no evidence that can be presented that would change their mind that drivers cannot be allowed to drive under the influence of marijuana. 


From the study:

&gt;The proportion of persons driving under the influence of alcohol is estimated at 2.1% (95%
CI: 1.4-2.8) and under the influence of cannabis at 3.4% (2.9%-3.9%). Drivers under the
influence of alcohol are 17.8 times (12.1-26.1) more likely to be responsible for a fatal acci-
dent, and the proportion of fatal accidents which would be prevented if no drivers ever
exceeded the legal limit for alcohol is estimated at 27.7% (26.0%-29.4%). Drivers under the
influence of cannabis multiply their risk of being responsible for causing a fatal accident by
1.65 (1.16-2.34), and the proportion of fatal accidents which would be prevented if no drivers ever drove under the influence of cannabis is estimated at 4.2% (3.7%-4.8%)


1.65x more likely to cause a fatal accident with marijuana. Not very significant, especially when compared to 17.8x more likely with alcohol. 


""Even so, driving when you know you're 1.65x more deadly is unacceptable,"" most will say. 


But it's not true, and in practice *they* don't believe it's true either. 


For example, bad weather is almost exactly as deadly as drunk driving in the US, roughly 10k deaths a year attributed to each. 


But there is no ideology to prevent people from driving in the rain. So no one has any problem with people driving in the rain *at* *all*.  Save for maybe some parents of new drivers who don't let their kids drive in bad weather, we all do it all the time.  And we don't care at when other people do it either. 


Sure we might offer some platitude ""be careful out there.  It's really coming down.""  And this, I think, demonstrates one of the more interesting elements, that *we* *know* driving in the rain is dangerous. On a conscious level we know it. It isn't that we are oblivious or ignorant of the danger, we just have decided that it is acceptable. We even try to drive more carefully, just like an inebriated driver would usually do.


It is always a choice to drive in the rain. It's funny how ridiculous and unacceptable the thought of it is, but it is nevertheless true that you can wait until the weather clears up before you drive. And if you did you would be ~17.8x less deadly. If everyone stopped driving in bad weather we would save around 10k lives a year. That's like three 9/11s every year. 


Even if you only drove in bad weather when you absolutely needed to, like getting to work or going to the hospital, you would be so much less likely to cause a fatal accident. So many lives would be saved. But very few drivers are dissuaded by the weather. 


""But you *choose* to be inebriated, so you can prohibit it. You can't prohibit bad weather, because no one is responsible for it,"" many will say. 


Ask yourself, would you be more permissive of drunk drivers if somehow it wasn't their choice to be drunk?  Probably not.



We willfully tolerate driving in bad weather, an activity that is almost exactly as deadly as drunk driving. But even though driving under the influence of marijuana is demonstrably safer than driving in the rain (hell, it's probably safer than driving at night too), it can never be tolerated in most people's minds because of ideology.

"It's actually probably much higher because they are only counting deaths directly caused by measles, but measles vaccination has also decreased all-cause mortality in children as well.  Measles infection has a nasty habit of ""deprogramming"" your immune system's memory which was recently found to be a long term effect (2-3 years).  So, kids who get measles aren't just at risk of dying from measles complications but also are more likely to die of other infections.  Getting vaccinated protects kids not just from measles but also maintains a healthier immune system.

source:  [Long-term measles-induced immunomodulation increases overall childhood infectious disease mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4823017/)

&gt;    **Abstract**: Immunosuppression after measles is known to predispose people to opportunistic infections for a period of several weeks to months. Using population-level data, we show that measles has a more prolonged effect on host resistance, extending over 2 to 3 years. We find that nonmeasles infectious disease mortality in high-income countries is tightly coupled to measles incidence at this lag, in both the pre- and post-vaccine eras. We conclude that long-term immunologic sequelae of measles drive interannual fluctuations in nonmeasles deaths. This is consistent with recent experimental work that attributes the immunosuppressive effects of measles to depletion of B and T lymphocytes. Our data provide an explanation for the long-term benefits of measles vaccination in preventing all-cause infectious disease. By preventing measles-associated immune memory loss, vaccination protects polymicrobial herd immunity.

"Study: [Decline in global oceanic oxygen content during the past five decades](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7641/full/nature21399.html)
___

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;Ocean models predict a decline in the dissolved oxygen inventory of the global ocean of one to seven per cent by the year 2100, caused by a combination of a warming-induced decline in oxygen solubility and reduced ventilation of the deep ocean. It is thought that such a decline in the oceanic oxygen content could affect ocean nutrient cycles and the marine habitat, with potentially detrimental consequences for fisheries and coastal economies. Regional observational data indicate a continuous decrease in oceanic dissolved oxygen concentrations in most regions of the global ocean, with an increase reported in a few limited areas, varying by study. Prior work attempting to resolve variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations at the global scale reported a global oxygen loss of 550 ± 130 teramoles (1012 mol) per decade between 100 and 1,000 metres depth based on a comparison of data from the 1970s and 1990s. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of the entire ocean oxygen inventory by analysing dissolved oxygen and supporting data for the complete oceanic water column over the past 50 years. We find that the global oceanic oxygen content of 227.4 ± 1.1 petamoles (1015 mol) has decreased by more than two per cent (4.8 ± 2.1 petamoles) since 1960, with large variations in oxygen loss in different ocean basins and at different depths. We suggest that changes in the upper water column are mostly due to a warming-induced decrease in solubility and biological consumption. Changes in the deeper ocean may have their origin in basin-scale multi-decadal variability, oceanic overturning slow-down and a potential increase in biological consumption."
I wonder whether they used an equally sleep-deprived control population... 
"They are drawing some long bows here IMHO.

&gt;Compared to men, women litter less, recycle more, and leave a smaller carbon footprint. 

Is that actually true, given a number of studies have shown that women are higher spending consumers that men, so shouldn't that translate into a higher carbon footprint?


&gt; In one study, we threatened the masculinity of male participants by showing them a pink gift card with a floral design and asking them to imagine using the card to purchase three products (lamp, backpack, and batteries).  Compared to men shown a standard gift card, threatened men were more likely to choose the non-green rather than green version of each item. 

That ""study"" is only highlighting a preference for particular colors and/or designs of gift cards, and trying to associate that with eco-friendly behavior is ridiculous. That or the article is terribly worded.

&gt;Something as simple as holding a purse, ordering a colorful drink, or talking in a **high voice** can lead to social harm, so men tend to keep a sharp eye out for any of these potential snares.

"The letter: https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/doi/10.1093/biosci/bix125/4605229

&gt;Twenty-five years ago, the Union of Concerned Scientists and more than 1700 independent scientists, including the majority of living Nobel laureates in the sciences, penned the 1992 ""World Scientists' Warning to Humanity"" (see supplemental file S1). These concerned professionals called on humankind to curtail environmental destruction and cautioned that ""a great change in our stewardship of the Earth and the life on it is required, if vast human misery is to be avoided."" In their manifesto, they showed that humans were on a collision course with the natural world. They expressed concern about current, impending, or potential damage on planet Earth involving ozone depletion, freshwater availability, marine life depletion, ocean dead zones, forest loss, biodiversity destruction, climate change, and continued human population growth. They proclaimed that fundamental changes were urgently needed to avoid the consequences our present course would bring.

&gt;The authors of the 1992 declaration feared that humanity was pushing Earth's ecosystems beyond their capacities to support the web of life. They described how we are fast approaching many of the limits of what the ­biosphere can tolerate ­without ­substantial and irreversible harm. The scientists pleaded that we stabilize the human population, describing how our large numbers-swelled by another 2 billion people since 1992, a 35 percent increase-exert stresses on Earth that can overwhelm other efforts to realize a sustainable future (Crist et al. 2017). They implored that we cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and phase out fossil fuels, reduce deforestation, and reverse the trend of collapsing biodiversity.

&gt;On the twenty-fifth anniversary of their call, we look back at their warning and evaluate the human response by exploring available time-series data. Since 1992, with the exception of stabilizing the stratospheric ozone layer, humanity has failed to make sufficient progress in generally solving these foreseen environmental challenges, and alarmingly, most of them are getting far worse (figure 1, file S1). Especially troubling is the current trajectory of potentially catastrophic climate change due to rising GHGs from burning fossil fuels (Hansen et al. 2013), deforestation (Keenan et al. 2015), and agricultural production-particularly from farming ruminants for meat consumption (Ripple et al. 2014). Moreover, we have unleashed a mass extinction event, the sixth in roughly 540 million years, wherein many current life forms could be annihilated or at least committed to extinction by the end of this century.

Lets say you take down a game animal. You eat as much of it as you can until you're full, but can't finish the remaining amount of meat. The idea is that you can share your food with those who might not have food in hopes that in the future when you don't have food but they do, they will remember that and share it with you. By developing and understanding this trust and conceptualizing it, it allowed us to evolve into more complex social structures and building trusting relationships."

Everytime the mother took him to urgent care for a ""cold"" he would be admitted to the hospital. After the 3rd time this happened I told the mom ""Please have him come here first"".

"Abstract from the Article:
""Maintaining grey matter within the hippocampus is important for healthy cognition. Playing 3D-platform video games has previously been shown to promote grey matter in the hippocampus in younger adults. In the current study, we tested the impact of 3D-platform video game training (i.e., Super Mario 64) on grey matter in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of older adults. Older adults who were 55 to 75 years of age were randomized into three groups. 

The video game experimental group (VID; n = 8) engaged in a 3D-platform video game training over a period of 6 months. Additionally, an active control group took a series of self-directed, computerized music (piano) lessons (MUS; n = 12), while a no-contact control group did not engage in any intervention (CON; n = 13). 

After training, a within-subject increase in grey matter within the hippocampus was significant only in the VID training group, replicating results observed in younger adults. Active control MUS training did, however, lead to a within-subject increase in the DLPFC, while both the VID and MUS training produced growth in the cerebellum. In contrast, the CON group displayed significant grey matter loss in the hippocampus, cerebellum and the DLPFC.""

There are a bunch more cases, but I think those references are enough to make the point that this is not a unique discovery.

I very much hope some of these wind up being able to be used to break down plastics in an industrial capacity, but so far that has eluded us."

It would be an interesting follow up study to investigate the morbidity of associated avoidable illness.  I would suspect that not only do people live markedly longer but that in their later years they have lives less impaired by disability.  
Thank you for doing this AMA. The suicide rate in the trans community is shocking. Are familiar with research on the risk and protective factors for suicide among trans youth?

Hopefully this will be able to start replacing silicon within the next 10-15 years since silicon has almost reached the ceiling for node shrinkage and performance/efficiency improvement.
"This change was just implemented this fall for my junior year, so I`ve already had 2 years of waking up at 5:45 every morning to compare it to . It really does make a difference, I have much more energy for my first few classes especially. Just waking up at sunrise instead it being dark until 2nd hour is refreshing. There's also lots of controversy surrounding it here, such as activities ending later in the afternoon. "

People move in this country so often that I have a perspective most don't; I've lived in the same house for 50 years. Just in the past 5 years I've had to put in water control systems in my yard that were not required even 10 years ago. Anyone moving in here would just think ""it must have always been like this"" but it hasn't. ""Gully washers"" that used to be a rare phenomenon now happen every couple weeks here in the summer. (I have 3 acres outside of Philadelphia.) My neighbors have had to do the same. We now regularly get temporary rivers (arroyos?) going across our yards that we have to control and make sure don't go into any of our buildings or other areas where they could cause damage.

In my opinion, much of social science has been dependent on small-scale qualitative studies or small experiments with unreproducible results, resulting in the situation described here (http://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0015). We're going to approach social science like a physics lab: by building large-scale multiplayer games and creating a ""supercollider"" to study collective behavior. An LHC of social science, if you will.

"&gt; DURHAM, N.C. - Alligators on the beach. Killer whales in rivers. **Mountain lions miles from the nearest mountain.**

Well... the article doesn't seem very objective from the start at all. Mountain lions do not necessarily live in a mountain. While alligators on beaches isn't unheard of if it's near a body of water that has a population of them in tropical areas. And about the killer whales, I have only managed to find one recent event near the mouth of river Clyde in Scotland but that pluralization is a bit misleading"

"What a ridiculously dishonest article. Even the ""study"" in question doesn't claim that immigrants don't increase crime. Actually, it's the opposite...

The short story is: High-skill, professional, legal immigrants who assimilate to the culture and speak the language don't contribute to an increase in crime. HOWEVER, unskilled immigrants from differing, conflicting cultures, who don't speak the language and are unable to integrate DO increase crime rates significantly. "

"As a Kinesiologist I can say with absolute confidence that looking for ways to make fat (aka stored energy) ""disappear is the biggest waste of time, and will absolutely have negative effects on your body. To try and force beta oxidation and Krebs cycle via a magic pill will certainly result in excess energy which more than likely will result in issues with blood pressure, heart defibrilation, hypertension, possible diabetes (excess glucose floating around in the blood stream), and definitely insulin coma. 

Mice can probably handle this because of the speed at which they can metabolize the energy based on the speed at which they move. Human will literally have a heart attack...especially if no exercise is involved. 

It took years to put on the weight...its going to take hard work and dedication to burn it off. 

Swim! It's low impact, should be done at a low intensity, long duration, and for someone who is overweight (fat floats) it can be a great way to get your body into aerobic glycolysis (conversion of lactic acid into pyruvate, and activation of beta oxidation and the Krebs cycle to metabolize fat. These processes need time to be completed, hence the increased duration of the workout. Your body will not pull from it's fat stores unless it has the time and energy to do so) without damaging the joints and extremities from the ground and pound of running. If you are overweight, running will destroy your feet, ankles, and knees if not done at a proper slow pace. 

I know it sucks...but it didn't suck when you were crushing calories like it was going out of style.

Edit:
Thanks for the comments everyone! I wasn't very specific with this comment, but I wanted to clarify my position and say that I am very much anti-smoking. I am a family physician and spend a lot of time on education and cessation efforts for people. I rejoice when they quit. Sadly, even with education, nicotine replacement, chantix, support groups etc.. many people will -never- be able to quit. They'll smoke themselves to the grave. The addiction is amazingly powerful, and it is painfully hard to quit.

I'm not an expert on taxation, but my impression is that vice taxes in general affect the poor far more than the rich. Sure, it may seem good to make cigarettes expensive to force a choice... but these people don't really have a choice. That was robbed from them long ago by tobacco companies and the culture surrounding them. Psychosocial pressures are very strong to keep smoking. 
The biggest overall threat to health is poverty, but poverty is complex. It's generational and cultural and based on far more than just ""hard-work"". Don't blame the poor for smoking. Many got started as kids! But unlike other stupid things we all did as kids, the addiction continues. If you have to blame (probably not a good idea, just do what you can to help,) blame a culture that allows it to continue, and for tobacco companies to continue, against health and common sense, to maim and kill millions of people each year. 
Every smoker I treat -knows- it will likely kill them. Many already are themselves or have a loved one with COPD, cancer, heart disease... but they are almost powerless. I try hard to empower them with solutions and education. But until the culture surrounding them changes, it's an uphill battle. These folks will pay $20 a pack if they have to. They have very little choice in the matter."

The things that we're not seeing in these studies which I would like to see are how is the quality of life towards the end of their lives? Are people on higher alcohol consumption more likely to have things like arthritis, mobility issues, muscle failures, etc...And can those be avoided with exercise and diet?

For someone like me- early 30s, excellent diet, ultramarathoner who also does core workouts and stretching, also enjoys an unhealthy amount of alcohol, my largest concern with alcohol is I'm going to have horrible health problems in my late 50s and early 60s and still live another 20 years with problems, vs being able to stay active through at least my late 70s and then if health problems come in late 70s, early 80s... meh"
